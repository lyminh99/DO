    nvlDC"How long have I been walking with Azzurra, hand-in-hand? I can't tell for certain, but we have been traveling towards the City."
    nvlDC"\n At first my thought was only to take her as far as we can from that wretched place. But then at some point I realized two things I forgot to note as we set out."
    nvlDC"\n Azzurra has been staying silent after we walked through that creaky doorway. No comment, no interjection, no nothing. It is as if I am being accompanied by a shade in the night, not the Azzurra I know and like."
    nvlDC"\n I can accept her silence to some extent. Whatever she has observed, or heard, or thought, over the past few days has been way above and beyond anything an ordinary girl could have expected to."
    nvlDC"\n But then there's the second problem that I need to address."
    nvlDC"\n Rescuing was the easy part. The hard part is... where to now?
\n 
    "
    nvlDC"\n Think, Anatolio, think! I can't bring Ana back to her home, nor mine, They would invariably find out, and “we'd be in hot water” would be a mere euphemism then."
    nvlDC"\n What about calling on Elena's favor and hide Azzurra at her estate? Sounds good, except for the part that anything Elena-related would mean trouble aplenty."
    nvlDC"\n How about Hanes? No, after his 'guarantee' for Azzurra's 'relatives', I doubt he's someone I can completely trust on this matter.
\n 
    "
    nvlDC"\n And Father Fredo?
\n 
    "
    nvlDC"\n Maybe he's the man. Ever since we were kids, he's been consistently bailing us out – including that event three years ago."
    nvlDC"\n But then if Hanes has become somehow untrustworthy because of possible involvement in this business, would that not apply to the good shepherd too?"
    nvlDC"\n And given the stuff I've been seeing and getting tangled in over the past week, suddenly the clergy have become scary to my eyes, for good reason."
    nvlDC"\n What now?"
    nvlDC"\n A grimace etches itself ever more deeply on my face.

    Az" Thinking something, Anatolio?"
    A" Eh... uh... nothing in particular."

    " I've certainly looked better. Still... as the guy planning a rescue shouldn't I have thought of our destination before the deed is done?"
    "But this is not something I wish to concern Azzurra with. This is my problem – I have to find a place for Azzurra to lay low until the heat dies down. Heck, I must even build that place if need be."
    "That's my duty. Mine and mine alone."
    "… though Azzurra doesn't quite seem to agree: I feel a pinch in the palm of my hand."

    A"  … Yeowch!"
    show Azu P52 at center
    Az" No need to hide, Ana. You haven't thought of what to do next after this daring rescue, have you?"

    " What can I do but to scratch my scalp like a boy who hasn't done his homework?"

    A" H-how do you know?"

    " Then she smiles, and winks at me understandingly."

    show Azu P53 at center
    Az" I understand you, Anatolio. You'd rather set out doing things before thinking it through, and what you do think before doing, you never do so carefully."

    Az"  Am I not right?"

    " I stop dead in my track, not sure if I should be offended or accept defeat."

    A"  …"
    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" Well, that means I'm right, no?"

    " Azzurra covers her giggle. Talk about the embarrassment..."

    A" H-hey! D-don't look at me like that; there's going to be a way as long as there's a will! And I, well, I have a will!"

    " Sure, I do have the will, but about clueless on the way part as a man blind."

    show Azu P42 at center
    Az"  So you do. And I... I have a way of my own."

    " Her eyes brighten, and I find myself filled with a kind of inexplicable dread. "
    "Should I shake or nod? I'm a drowning man in need of anything to grasp, at any rate!"

    A" Oh?"
    show Azu P45 at center
    Az"  Let's go to the chapel. To Father Fredo."
    A"  B-but Father Fredo is... well, he's a priest, if you forgot!"
    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" So?"
    A"  Are you dreaming or something? We can't trust the Church or the clergy in this matter!"
    show Azu P53 at center
    Az" Father Fredo is not entirely a man of the cloth, if you know what I mean."
    A" Doesn't mean he has nothing to do with this mess!"
    show Azu P42 at center
    Az" More's the reason I need to see him. Speak to him."
    A" But why? I, well, took me plenty of effort just to get you out of there! If-"
    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" Trust me, Anatolio. Father Fredo... is more than what catches your eyes. Unless, of course, you've got a better place in mind?"

    " Left brain gives up. Right brain surrenders. Middle brain waves the white flag. Nope, nothing here in the way of ideas."

    show Azu P41 at center
    Az" Then it is decided. I'll go to Father Fredo. And then..."
    A" … whatever happens, happens. (that what you think, Azzurra?)"
    show Azu P40 at center
    Az" No, I meant to say “I'll ask some questions long overdue”. But you... aren't entirely wrong."

    " My instinct screams at me. I'm making a huge mistake, it says. But then, if all we have is a hammer..."
    " Dark clouds begin to gather above our head. Another summer rain is coming. We've got to make haste."
