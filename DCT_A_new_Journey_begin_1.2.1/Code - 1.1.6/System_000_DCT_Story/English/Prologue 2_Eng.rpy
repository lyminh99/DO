    "I ran."
    "Ceaselessly."
    "My legs one after the other stomped on the asphalt. I ran past the market. Past the fountain. Past the enormous buildings just erected."
    "My eyes spun around.My head rang like a bell, the noises building up within my skull like an old machine's death throes growing unbearable."
    "A stream of bitter sweat flowed down my cheeks and upon my parched tongue."
    "A carriage rushed at my general direction, its wheels grinding on the puddles from yesternight's rain."
    "The stallion galloped at me, hooves beating down the sand-yellow earth."
    "To hell with it. I kept running, cutting across the carriage's front. Startled, the driver pulled the rein. Hard."
    "The horse reared, startled and quite obviously hurt, as the rein tugged him from behind."
    "“Sorry, pal!” was what I would have said if I had the time."
    "But I had none, so I didn't."
    "Behind me, someone was swearing. Not that I cared. My ears now had space for but one thing, and it was the whizzing wind about me"
    "My eyes peeled open. All the stakes were on them."
    "I observed and analyzed, as humanly fast as possible, the many faces on the street on such a day as today."
    "And then..."
    "I stopped before a lane."
    "Indeed the only place I had never set a foot into, today and all days before it."
    "It looked no more remarkable than a crack in the stet, stuck between two reinforced stone walls, deep as a hole to the abyss and about as inviting:"
    "Three feet wide, barely enough for a grown man. Not exactly a stellar hiding place."
    "But then again, if you were looking for a place to hide."
    "Could it be that Azzu-"

    A "Urgh..."

    "My kneecap suddenly loosened. I was controlled, obviously, by a pain that shot from my breast to the top of my cranium."
    "Like a jolt of electricity, running along my spine and filling my brain."
    "Was it an imagination? No, that one word could not cut it."
    "No, I had no time to hesitate – not any more."
    "I withdrew my hands from my failing knees and stood upright."

    BA"Quo Vadis?"

    "I was not sure if the call from behind me was directed at me. Should that be the case, even, I wasn't exactly in the shape to answer."
    "I inhaled deep. I dusted my sleeve, as if preparing for a supremely solemn ceremony. Slowly. Calmly."
    "I stepped on my sweat that had fallen on the ground, crushing them into the dirt. One step. Two step. Three. "
    "The shadow – the beast – opened its jaws and swallowed the interloper like a lion would a lost fly."
