    " We quickly make our way to the wagon that I hope is still around."
    " It is. What a pleasant surprise: Elena is still waiting patiently for us. "
    " As if she's stopped being the haughty Lady De'Rovere while I wasn't looking, and has become a beauteous fair maiden in the meantime."
    " Elena glances at Azzurra, then at me, then back at Azzurra again. And then bursts out in a giggle"

    E" Welcome back, my ladyship!"

    " Elena makes a pretend curtsy."

    A" So y-you are here, too...?"

    " Azzurra stops in her track, probably not knowing what to say. I have to say something in her stead, and fast!"

    A" Can we hold this off until a bit? Let's be on our way; wouldn't be good if they come back!"

    "Elena raises her hand in a two-finger salute."

    E"Aye, aye, Ser Pietro!"

    " We pull Azzurra up on the wagon."
    "What follows is absolute silence. Elena and Azzurra don't even bother to look at each other."
    "To be exact, they did blink at each other exactly once the moment Azzurra sits down, as if confirming a prior agreement."
    "Or perhaps the tiredness has taken its toll on my eyesight. No, I'm sure I've never been more alert than I am right now."
    "I'm supposed to relax. Everything is done, right? Have I not succeeded? Then why am I having this feeling like something isn't right?"

    A" Eh... what's with the silence? Something wrong?"

    " I turn towards Azzurra. She stares at the floor and says nothing."
    "Then I look at Elena – and get a meaningful wink plus a mischievous-sounding shush."
    "That's odd. If anything I'm supposed to be the one making that 'please don't ask anything' gesture. What's this bizarre world I've gotten into?"

    A" Say again?"

    E" If a lady wishes not to speak, a gentleman should not try to engage in conversation. Ana gets it, doesn't he?"

    " Actually, I don't. Since when has Elena been on Azzurra's side?"

    A" But..."

    " One shake and one nod in quick succession."

    E" Elena reckons Ana should take the occasion to see the sight. Will be quite a while before Ana gets another oh-so-convenient opportunity..."

    " Now she turns away, making clear she's going to hear no more of my complaints."
    "If I had a copper coin every time Elena assumes that know-it-all attitude, I'd be a rich man now. "
    "This, just now, is when that attitude is most uncalled for."
    "Nothing I can do about that, I guess."
    "Nothing, except to do what she says – see the sight. Perhaps she has a point. After this business comes to an end, it will not be easy to get to leave the city again. "
    "After the coming-of-age thing, I'll be an everyday grown-up citizen. Which means leaving the City would require a proper paperwork and all that."

    CV" M'lady, where to now?"

    " Elena glances at me. “Your turn,” reads the look in her eyes."

    E"Ser Pietro?"

    " Wait a second... I haven't actually thought about where we should go next after we've got Azzurra, so preoccupied I was about the rescue itself!"
    "Think, Anatolio, think! You can't bring Azzurra back to her place, nor mine. Elena can provide some help, but then I realize that is Elena I was thinking about, and that alone means complication."
    "How about Hanes? No, after his 'guarantee' for Azzurra's 'relatives', I doubt he's someone I can completely trust on this matter."
    "And Father Fredo?"
    "Maybe he's the man. Ever since we were kids, he's been consistently bailing us out – including that event three years ago."
    "But then if Hanes has become somehow untrustworthy because of possible involvement in this business, would that not apply to the good shepherd too?"
    "And given the stuff I've been seeing and getting tangled in over the past week, suddenly the clergy have become scary to my eyes, for good reason."
    "What now?"

    E" If Ana can't make up his mind, Elena shall do it for him, alright?"
    A" W-wait a second, I-."

    " Elena shakes her head, as if I have nothing worth saying (which, in a sense, is kinda sorta true)."
    show Azu Ele P011 at center    
    E" Then let's to Father Fredo's chapel then."
    A" Father Fredo? B-but..."

    " Think about it! That kind of is your most palatable choice right now!"

    E" What's the matter, Ana? Elena should think that would be Ana's most palatable choice right now, isn't it?"

    " Sure, let's add “telepathy” to the list of special abilities Elena may or may not have that I need to keep an eye out for."

    A" But..."

    " Elena looks at me understandingly."
    show Azu Ele P004 at center
    E" Or let's make it this way: If something wrong should happen, Ana can take Azzurra to Elena's place. "

    E" Elena may be no Duchess, but she has her own way to help out. Would that work?"
    show Azu Ele P011 at center
    " I bite my lip. Not sure I like the thought, but does it look like I have any better choice?"

    A" And Azzurra? What say you?"
    A" No objection whatsoever."

    " Suddenly I see Azzurra's eyes blink. The thought of going to Father Fredo, apparently, must have triggered a certain rejoice in her. "
    "Seems like I cannot really object even if I had a better option on hand."

    A" Very well then. To the chapel it is."

    " My instinct screams at me. I'm making a huge mistake, it says. But then, if all we have is a hammer..."
    "Dark clouds begin to gather above our head. Another summer rain is coming. I'm just so grateful we're riding and not walking.  "
