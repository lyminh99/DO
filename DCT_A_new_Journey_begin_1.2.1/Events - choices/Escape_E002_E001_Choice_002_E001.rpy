    " Azzurra has already spoken for me. "
    "I still want to think Father Fredo a friend of ours – and until a few days ago I daresay we could not have asked for a more faithful. "
    "But now? I have to assume the worst hypothesis."
    "That he is an enemy. In which case I have to face that reality... and extract the truth, at any cost!"
    "Now he looks at me, as if silently interrogating me. “Has Chaos finally taken Azzurra over?” he seems to say."
    "Well, sorry to say, Father, but we know. Oh, we know, Father, and you owe us an answer long overdue."

    A" It is exactly like Azzurra said, Father."

    F" ..."

    " The quiet he's fallen into seems so suspicious to my ears... and scary."
    "No, I am not allowed to let myself fall into fear just yet. "
    "He may be the representative of the Creator on earth, but he is still human. And human are prone to errors, and accordingly can be beaten."

    A" You know, didn't you? Didn't you?"

    " It is all I can do not to throw what papers I have found in that hideout in his face. "
    " I can't risk them just yet."

    show Azu Fredo P1 at center
    F" … I don't quite get what you're talking about."
    A"  All I want is to know, Father..."
    A" … what the common man would think, knowing that the pillar of justice that is Father Fredo would mingle with the likes of Aurora?"

    " Father Fredo's face twists. I haven't got my evidence ready, but my triumphant self is spilling all over. "
    "Annoyingly so, objectively speaking."

    show Azu Fredo P2 at center
    F" Be very careful with your accusations, Messer Pietro."

    " His voice rumbles, coldly and echoing all over, like a calling from beyond the grave. I take a single step backward without even knowing I did."

    show Azu Fredo P3 at center
    F" False accusations against a man of the cloth is no joke. I thought you knew better."
    A" Well, then what are you burning right there, Father? If my accusation is false, you have nothing to hide, do you?"
    show Azu Fredo P2 at center
    F" Not quite, Pietro. The burden of proof is on you. "
    show Azu Fredo P0 at center
    F" Besides, your accusation has nothing to do with what I do in my own room."

    " I keep my silence for a moment. What option have I got? If Father Fredo wants to play all his cards, then I'm not without my own hand either."
    "… no, this is not yet the time to present those documents. That is my ace in the hole for the last minute."

    show Azu Fredo P2 at center
    F" Perhaps you haven't thought this over. "
    F"I won't hold any grudge against you – as a young man, it's all too easy to be controlled by momentary outbursts-"

    "His voice mellows down, while my teeth grind."

    show Azu Fredo P0 at center
    F" You can turn around and step out of the room, and none of this has happened. Otherwise-"
    A" What if I have that evidence you want?"
    show Azu Fredo P1 at center
    F"  Oh?"
    A" I've found – at you-know-where – a bunch of letters bearing both the sign of Aurora and the seal of Church officials. "
    A" That's some nice letters, and I wonder what would happen if the people on the street get hold of them..."
    show Azu Fredo P2 at center
    F" Do not make up such filthy lies, Pietro!"
    A" Would you like a wager, Father?"

    " I lift my lips in a smirk."

    A" Of course you wouldn't – you have nothing to gain and everything to lose. Am I right, Father?"

    " Again Father Fredo keeps his quiet. I am beaming inside, and have to try my very best to keep my voice as solemn and challenging as I can."
    "But then his face twists. His fiery eyes widens, his jaws clench, as are his fists. "
    "There he stands before me, a mountain of a man ready to crush me to a pulp in a blink of an eye."
    "Just then, he resembles more a demon than a holy man, and – believe me – a demon in the flesh might actually be less frightening than he is."

    F" Excellent work. Excellent work, Pietro. That's what you think, is it? Think you it's so easy to blackmail the Church – the Church! Of all things?"
    A" W-what do you mean?"

    F" One warning. One. Let it be, Anatolio. If you know what's good for you."
    A"  And why are you telling me this?"

    F" I wish to harm neither you nor Azzurra."
    A" lie! You've already harmed Azzurra, You know it!"

    F" Then prove it!"
    A" I have here in my hands-"
    show Azu Fredo P1 at center
    F" … a bunch of forgeries as Aurora is wont to make. Fake seals, fake signatures – worthless in the eyes of any respectable member of society."
    show Azu Fredo P0 at center
    F" And my name isn't even on them."

    " Sweat begins to drip from my forehead."

    A" How do you know that?"

    " That should have been a confession, in the 'I never said what it is' style, in any other circumstance... except this!"

    show Azu Fredo P2 at center

    " I shudder. Hard."

    F" Do not force my hands, Anatolio Pietro."

    " I back off a couple steps for the breathing space. "
    "I look around the room – between Father Fredo and Azzurra. The former still stares at me without a blink. The latter..."
    "Azzurra keeps her head down. And shakes."

    Az" I... see. In that case. Our apologies for the rudeness, Father."

    " Wait just a second there! Giving up so easy, Azzura? Aren't you dying for an answer?"
    "Anatolio the coward within me clears his voice. It's the end, he says. You lost, he says. "
    "Run away, he says, run for your life. You don't know what trouble you're causing for yourself, he screams in my ears."
    "Run. Just run. Run away. Run home. Home, home, HOME!"
    "No."
    "I'm not running away this time."
    "I've been a coward all my (rather short) life who knows nothing but to fool around and think myself great. "
    "Let's steel my limbs, now, and fight like I should have for a long time now."
    "And how am I doing that?"
    "And then my eyes catch the documents on the table. "
    "By the Creator, he hasn't managed to destroy them all, and he wouldn't have been in such a hurry if his Achilles' heel hadn't been in there!"

    A" I guess... thank you for your tolerance, Father-"

    " He nods once."

    A" ... Though I haven't showed my hand yet!"

    " Before he can react, I leap for the documents."
    "What has lent me such decisiveness, I can't for the life of me say. "
    "I'm just about to commit an act of great disrespect to the divine – probably not seen since Geronimo the Apostate set fire to the statue of St. Lucina years before."

    F" Pietro! What do you think you are doing?"

    " Now I am but a few pace from the good priest. When he realizes exactly what I thought to do, I've already been closer to my prize than he can help it."
    "His fiery eyes did send shocks up my spine. Should I go on?"
    "No, I think to myself. I need to do this."
    "If not for the truth itself, then for the arrogance of an Anatolio who has never accepted second prize to anyone but an Elena De'Rovere. I don't allow myself to lose this time."
    "The priest hasn't given up yet. Quickly he dashes towards where I am. He's taller than me by a head, and way larger. I suddenly begin to pity those who opposed him during his Templar days..."
    "Well, but they are they. And I – a curious boy who grew up on his smarts – am I. More agile, and more alert.."
    "One jump, one dodge, one grab... and one long slide along the floor. The maneuver ends with a spectacular brake with both feet – if I say so myself."
    "Father Fredo missed me, and now I'm quite a way from him, behind the safety of the nearest table. And most of all, in possession of the thing he was going to just destroy just now."
    "Defeated for now, the priest stops, folds his arms and shakes his head."

    show Azu Fredo P2 at center
    F" Pietro... You... disappoint me."
    A" That's supposed to be my line, Father!"

    " I do my best to keep him on his toe around the table as my eyes skim the document at the top of the pile."
    "What I want is an implicating seal... or a signature..."
    "..."
    "Wait, what is this I am seeing?"

    A"  … Hanes?"

    " That single word escapes my lips, and carries way further than I thought."
    "The room freezes at that single word."
    "I stare blankly at the sheet. No, even if that isn't his name there, then I've been his pal for long enough to recognize his handwriting at a glance."
    "We've tried imitating each other's signature once upon a time!"
    "It is Hanes. Hanes who signed here."
    "My worst fear, confirmed. Hanes is involved in this business, more or less. “More” seems to be the likely possibility."
    "There Father Fredo stands, feet rooted to the floor. His arms fall to his side; his eyes paralyzed. He shakes his head – like having given up for good."
    "Azzurra, too, is rolling her eyes. She must have been prepared for every possible scenario. Every scenario, except this."
