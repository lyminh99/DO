    nvlDC"The chapel, the House of the Creator, should be the closest place to godliness in this sinful world. So they say, anyway."
    nvlDC"\n What they don't know is, on an afternoon like this, the House of the Creator seems like the closest place to evil."
    nvlDC"\n No preaching, no praying, no ethereal choir nor pious congregation... nothing but the candlelight on the pulpit.    "
    nvlDC"\n Outside, the horizon is dominated by thunderclaps and flashes of lightning. It is early still, way before dinner time, yet the sky is pitch black. The shapes on the stained glass windows dance in the lightning, macabre and alien."
    nvlDC"\n I recall having been lost in the chapel at least once as a child. Then Father Fredo's appearance from a door behind the pulpit – that space a child doesn't know exists – scared me half to death. Funny, what children do. Anything just slightly out of the ordinary would all look like baby-eating monsters."
    nvlDC"\n But on the other hand since then we've known to look for Father Fredo behind that door whenever we need him. I'm sure many even among the grown-ups aren't yet aware of that."
    nvlDC"\n So I hold Azzurra's hand tightly in mine, and step towards the raised platform at the end of the aisle."
    nvlDC"\n The door I'm talking about lies beneath the bas-relief of the Creator, many-winged and bathed in light, and is never locked."
    nvlDC"\n Perhaps Father Fredo thought the protection of the divine is enough, and above and beyond any threat the mortal man can visit upon him?"
    nvlDC"\n In which case, would I be disrespecting the Creator and His Court to just barge in there unbidden?"
    nvlDC"\n I swallow hard, and try to keep my body still. Forgive me, O Creator Who Art In Heaven, but this sinful child just has to trespass..."
    nvlDC"\n We haven't yet set foot on the platform when my nostrils catch the distinct smell of something burning behind the half-closed doorway."
    nvlDC"\n A thin sheen of smoke wafts out from behind, and I can almost catch the reflection of a dancing flame against the varnished door. That's no candle!"
    nvlDC"\n Is there a fire?"
    nvlDC"\n Only one way to find out."

    A"  Azzurra?"

    "Azzurra said nothing, and just nodded. That's all the signal I need."
    "Still holding her hand, I throw the door open. It hits the wall with a loud thud just as we charge through the doorway."
    "And at once I am treated with a scene I'd never expect to see in a chapel."
    "There Father Fredo kneels, before the fireplace, and setting fire to a bunch of things that doesn't look like tinderwood."
    "Father Fredo turns back with a start – just enough for us to catch what he's burning: A pile of paper, about half an inch thick."

    A" Father?"

    F" Anatolio? And... Azzurra?"

    "He stares at us, frozen. The calmness he is normally known for disappears."

    F" What are you doing here?"

    "Is it just me or does he look like he's more surprised that Azzurra is here than that we've barged into his place uninvited?"
    "Suddenly I don't know what I should do first: apologize to him for our trespassing, or ask him right away what is going on here."
    "And then Azzurra speaks before I can make up my mind."
