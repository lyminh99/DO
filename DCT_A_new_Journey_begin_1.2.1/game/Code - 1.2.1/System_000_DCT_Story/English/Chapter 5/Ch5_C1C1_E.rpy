    "I draw an overly dramatic breath."
    "Shall I test my luck? Elena is, after all, a good woman. Sassy and bit of an unconventional sense of humor, but good. She will understand... right? Right? As long as I don't give too much away..."
    A" Azzurra's business. You see..."
    "Elena freezes in her track. It takes her but a second to regain her footing, but I understand the implication all too well."

    E" Elena... sees. Ana misses Azzurra."
    A" Well, you see-"
    E" Would Ana allow Elena a question? If Elena is to vanish from Ana's life like Azzurra does... would Ana miss Elena that much?"
    A" Of course!"
    "Again Elena freezes. No, not just her, but me too. That was spoken without a thought, without the least preparation, calculation or word-mincing. That's what I truly feel."

    E" Ana... speaks true, right?"
    "Elena looks at me, a silent declaration of “If Ana lies, Elena will know”. I exhale loudly: right, I'm not lying. I have no reason to fear, not a one!"
    A" If you are to vanish from my side one of those days, Elena, well, I will go find you. If that happens, and if Azzurra is around, she'd be sad, too, and she'd go find you with me. Don't you think the same, Elena?"
    "Elena's lips quiver. I don't think I remember the last time I forced Elena into a situation she had not expected like this. This might even be the first time such a thing has happened. Suddenly Elena looks that much more vulnerable than she normally does..."

    E" Elena... Elena... Elena wants to disbelieve it... because it doesn't make so much sense... Yet Elena can't help but believe Ana..."
    "Show of hands, Anatolio. Show of hands."
    A" The truth is... I want to go to the outskirts. See Azzurra's uncle and aunt. See how she's doing out there. If anyone's bullying her, that kind of thing. And let her know we aren't going to forget her just because she isn't around any more!"
    E" That's a whole day on foot. Has Ana made preparations?"
    A" Not yet, but there's a will, hence there's a way, right?"
    "I look at Elena in the eyes. Now it is her turn to take one step back."

    E" Int-Interesting thought, gentleman!"
    "Elena purses her lips."
    A" Just what I should do. You agree, don't you, Elena?"
    "And then, just then, another crazy flash of creativeness strikes me. I step towards Elena."
    A" Would you like to go with me?"
    "For a while Elena just stays silent – her hands curl, her brows tremble."
    E" When does Ana intend to go?"
    A" Early in the morning, the day after tomorrow."
    E" Then Elena will go with Ana. Wait a second, Elena can actually do one better!"
    "She turns around, and smiles at her two officers."
    E" Would Elena's gentle-servants help her on arrange for a carriage to the outskirts early the day after tomorrow? Some good men with discretion would be good, too!"

    NDO"  Your will be done, ma'am!"
    "Elena's decisiveness never fails to amaze and/or frighten me so."
    A" Wait, what? Would that even... you know, work out?"
    "Imagine this: A carriage bearing the emblem of House De'Rovere in all its glory, appearing in a place less traveled where it doesn't belong. Knowing what I'm actually going to be there for, this seems a bit..."
    "Imagine this too: Everyone was so quick to accept the closure of the bridge three years ago as the 'new normal'. Not many people bothered to cross it unless on important business these days when they reopen it again."
    "The nobility, as it turns out, were not missed here, or outside the City."
    "Elena, too, is part of that world that doesn't belong. Though our side of the bridge never dares to greet her with the same kind of hostility Azzurra got from the other side, she must certainly feel the eyes on her, too."
    "And now this? Either she doesn't know who or where she is, or..."

    E" Why would it not? Aren't we—"
    "Elena turns around."

    E" Isn't Azzurra Elena's friend, too?"
    "And so, just in a blink of an eye, Elena the nemesis of mine has completely turned into my redeemer. Just so simply."

    nvlDC"\n Breathe in. Breathe out. Relax. Good."
    nvlDC"\n My hands are deep inside my pocket as I walk along the market lane."
    nvlDC"\n The sun has not even risen. Some of the grocers have, though not that many, and much of the street is still in a deep sleep."
    nvlDC"\n I look up at the window sills, lamp-posts and the several archways along the street."
    nvlDC"\n Decorations bearing the likeness of the sun has started to be fixed in place. That once-every-ten-years festival is starting to take center stage..."
    nvlDC"\n A large banner has been hung in the pole at the middle of the piazza: you can see the symbol of a golden sun dispensing hundreds of golden rays there."
    nvlDC"\n Our meeting place is under that great banner. Elena said she would come take me after dawn. I'm not sure if she can find it within her to keep to the plan, though. The first time we had an appointment of sort, if I remember correctly, the only reason she was technically on time was that I was late myself."
    nvlDC"\n I rub my hands together. This year, somehow early summer still retains part of the chill of late spring. That, or maybe I'm just nervous."
    nvlDC"\n Now I've been waiting here for five, ten, no, fifteen minutes now, when I see that familiar shade of gold and crimson again. Elena's appearance made it worth the wait."
    nvlDC"\n There she sits, rather comfortably, too, on a wagon I never thought Elena would never even think about coming close, much less ride."
    nvlDC"\n That's no ebony carriage with velvet curtains and down-feathered pillows, nor an elegant two-man litter so fashionable among the nobility."
    nvlDC"\n No, I'm looking at a genuine, honest-to-Creator cargo wagon, pulled by two healthy draft stallions. I can't help but widen my eyes: Elena, what weirdness is on your mind this time?"
    nvlDC"\n Elena's “Scheme”, I realize, involves three of her guards wearing civilian clothes. Yet each of them bears on their side a solid longsword and slings across their back a sturdy round buckler."
    nvlDC"\n So, in a sense... it's what people can call a war chariot."
    nvlDC"\n As our eyes meet, Elena jumps off from the wagon. I look at her again: Elena today wears a pair of breeches and a tunic-gambeson thing. She can't be more different than the elegant Elena of every other day."

    E" Ser Elena de Rovere and the Knights of the Smiling Flower, present and at your service!"
    "She raises her hand for a military-esque salute. “Esque” being the keyword: it would take several lifetimes of men before the Elena I know can take after a fraction of her father's militarism."
    A" Elena... c-c-care for an explanation? Or two? Or three?"
    E" Go find Azzurra with Ana? What else did Ana expect?"
    "There is that mischievous smile on Elena's face, as if I were the silly one in this whole thing."
    E" Did Ana think Elena's noble sire would let her go to the outskirts, that land of the Apostates, just alone with Ana?"
    "Oh. Right. How did I forget about that? She is, after all, the scion of the highest echelon of nobility. Taking that into consideration, that much preparation she's got there is actually a little underwhelming."
    A" I... see. B-but “Knights of the Smiling Flower”?"
    E" Sounds good, doesn't it?"
    E" Isn't that just like the olden days, Ana? Ana still remembers, doesn't he?"
    "The Smiling Flower. That's it. Shes' been trying to remind me of those memories from so long ago. So much, I'm starting to feel more than a little guilty."
    A" Elena, I..."
    "Elena looks like she is trying to avoid my gaze. And just like that, she changes the topic."
    E" These are the best men in Elena's household. Should anything happen, they'd protect Ana and Elena with their lives."
    E" Of course, that is a big if. That's not going to happen, right, Ana?"
    "Tiny sweat drops form all over my forehead. Elena, my dear Elena, what kind of demon or spirit are you? What don't you know, again?"
    "And then she stretches her hands towards me. She smiles, like the summer sunshine. There is, apparently, nothing worth worrying about."
    E" Shall we, Ana?"
    A" B-but of course!"

    nvlDC"\n It is, all in all, a really quiet journey."
    nvlDC"\n Finding the way has been easier than I thought. Even without Mr. Attenborough's map, Azzurra's 'aunt' and 'uncle' did say they live on the edge of the furthest village to the North where the Church still holds sway."
    nvlDC"\n There's only one path that-a-way. Not paved, nor meticulously kept, but still rather lacking in bumps and molehills."
    nvlDC"\n As for the quiet? Let's say, on one hand, there'd be no one – clergy or beggar, bandits or busybodies, Templars or Aurora people – who'd risk raising a ruckus with a band of well-armed people like ours."
    nvlDC"\n On the other, my foremost troublemaker of usual who goes by the name Elena De'Rovere has been oddly quiet so far."
    nvlDC"\n Throughout the trip, she sits there, on the wooden bench that is not made with a noblewoman in mind, and said nothing at all. She keeps her left arm propping her chin, and her right neatly folded on her knee. Thinking something."
    nvlDC"\n I'm not sure what she is probably looking at. The sky? The earth? Clouds, trees, the river? Or the distant horizon?"
    nvlDC"\n What I do know is that I can't recall a time that Elena would appear so serious and focused. Like she's in the middle of a prayer most sacred, and not, say, on a sturdy wagon carrying soldiers."
    nvlDC"\n Elena's silence conflicts so much with her nature that I've started to feel anxious. Is she mad at me by any chance?"
    nvlDC"\n I wouldn't blame her. Elena hasn't actually taken in stride my “abandoning her” (because Azzurra needs me more). But that doesn't mean I am without blame."
    nvlDC"\n There's this fierce struggle within me. In the end, I decide I'll have to do something even more guilty to her again. Azzurra still needs me more."

    A" Been a bother, me, that is, Elena."
    "Elena turns around, looks at me, and smiles."

    E" Elena has mentioned before. Elena simply does what she fancies."
    A" Even so..."
    E" Elena understands. Ana is worried for Elena, right? Well, don't be."
    "Actually, no. I'm more worried for myself for that matter."
    "Elena points to her mercenary-like clothing, and there on her face blooms a smile as sudden as it is mature – so much unlike the 'normal' her."
    E" Elena is not feeble. Elena has made a vow before the Creator and His Court, and she will not back down."
    A" And that is...?"
    "Elena places a finger on her lips."
    E" Never ask a woman what her secrets are. Doesn't Ana agree?"
    E" Oh, and! Since when did Ana become so sentimental and... clingy! Ana can be more confident than that, right?"
    "Elena points to my nose. Then she turns away without another word. Is she avoiding something?"
    "No, it's not that I'm lacking in confidence."
    "Just that Mr. Attenborough's words made me think – there are just so many unknowns in this world of ours. And the unknown and shady has a way of making you more worried and less clear in your conviction."
    "That is the last Elena speaks until we reach our destination. The only sound I hear is the horseshoes clopping against the ground and the grinding wagon wheels. And the occasional clattering of metal."

    "It has taken us something in the neighborhood of three hours. The last half an hour has been devoted simply to finding Azzurra's place."
    "Now it's a house both easy and hard to find. Easy, as it is in the middle of an open field. It's rather large and neat-looking, with bright red tiles, stout oak windows and doors, and a white-yellow layer paint that has been peeled off here or there."
    "Hard? Because the whole place is hidden from sight of the main road by a curtain of old trees. It has taken our wagon a bumpy ride along a dirt path to get there. My poor behind is still aching."
    "Hardly has the wagon stops when Elena leaps off her seat."

    E" Oh, oh, our Azzurra is living rather well, isn't she?"
    A" Well! I do hope!"
    "I step off the back of the wagon, and fill my lungs with the fresh air of the meadow. The sun shines in my face: Golden, yet not uncomfortable."
    "I would have thought I'm here for a holiday, had Azzurra not been on my mind."
    "And that's exactly what I am to do. What I have to do."
    A" Elena... would you mind doing me another favor?"
    "Elena widens her eyes for but a split second."
    E" Ana doesn't need to ask. Elena is here today, and she will help Ana anything he asks."
    "My jaws clench: Now, how much and to what extent can I count on her, so that I don't accidentally reveal anything and still get the job done?"
    A" Well, then, actually, two favors. One, after I come in there, please don't follow me. If I don't come out after an hour, just leave without me,"
    E" Eh? What is Ana up to?"
    "I shake my head, raise my voice and interrupt her."
    A" And the second is... please, I beg you, don't ask. Until we return to the city, that is, then I'll tell what I can. Do you agree?"
    "It's a suspicious request, sure, but again Elena surprises me. She doesn't cling to me like she does, or demand an explanation. Not even an “Elena shall leave if Ana doesn't tell right now!”"
    "Oh no. She stands right there, and nods quietly."
    E" Elena understands. Ana can rest assured. Elena knows what to do."
    "What am I even supposed to do now, but nod and thank the Creator that everything is as they should be?"
    A" Well, off I go then. Wish me luck and remember what you said!"
    "Then I run towards the house. My hands are tucked in my jacket pocket: There a bronze key awaits along with a crumpled piece of note."
