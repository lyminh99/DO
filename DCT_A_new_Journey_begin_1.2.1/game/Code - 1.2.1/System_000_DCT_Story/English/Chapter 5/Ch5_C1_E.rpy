    nvlDC"\n I have been asking myself “Anatolio, you fool, what are you even doing?” all the way to the lake."
    nvlDC"\n I'm not... quite calm right now. True, if I were calmer, more rational, I would have realized this is as bad a choice as every other option I have. If not much, much worse."
    nvlDC"\n If these people (assuming they really are Aurora people) do not mean well, I'd be... well, not quite dead, I tell myself. Just a bit unprepared, that's all. Unprepared is bad, but not that bad, right, right?"
    nvlDC"\n Worse still would be if someone I know (and I'm sure that number is far too large for comfort) sees me discussing whatever matter with suspicious people... well, let's not dwell on what the Church would have done to the likes of me then!"
    nvlDC"\n Why am I even so brave again?"
    nvlDC"\n Is it because of Azzurra?"
    nvlDC"\n Or because of that curiosity innate to an arrogant fellow who eats, drinks and breathes the notion that he can handle everything life throws his way?"
    nvlDC"\n Or perhaps both?"
    nvlDC"\n In any case, now I'm standing right there, in front of the lake."
    nvlDC"\n My right hand brandishes a gnarly-looking branch freshly snagged from an old tree nearby. I'd loathe to be unarmed if bad comes to worse."
    nvlDC"\n The lake's great bank is as peaceful as it normally is. The sky is clear and cloudless. Up there, a million stars sparkle before my eyes, so real and so close yet so far – as if you'd only need to reach out, and there they'd be."
    nvlDC"\n I clutch my chest with my free hand, and then sit down on the grass."
    nvl clear

    A" Let it be, Anatolio. Let it be. Everything will be fine..."


    nvlDC"\n It's hard to persuade myself when my chest is thumping like a thousand drums. As if just one tiny sound, just one, would be enough to make my breast explode."
    nvlDC"\n So I wait."
    nvlDC"\n Five minutes."
    nvlDC"\n Ten."
    nvlDC"\n Fifteen. Twenty minutes. Half an hour."
    nvlDC"\n My patience trickles away with every passing second."

    A" Did they stand me up?"
    nvlDC"\n The feeling of being tricked passes down to my club hand. Where there was once anxiety, now there is disappointment. Let's put it like this: An appointment with the likes of Aurora is still something so new and alien and exciting to good old me, more than anything else I can reasonably get in life.  "
    nvlDC"\n And then there is the matter with Azzurra, too."
    nvlDC"\n Ever since this afternoon I've been trying to make heads or tails out of the mere notion that Azzurra might have something to do with these people."
    nvlDC"\n The most logical explanation is that Azzurra and her complicated life has drawn unwanted attention. Naturally, someone who caused a large chunk of the city to go ballistic in just a simple action, well, she'd be extraordinary, even though she has no desire for it."
    nvlDC"\n And someone extraordinary, I think with a shudder, will be pulled into the affairs of grown-ups – and not just any grown-up, but the powerful."
    nvlDC"\n But what about me? Why me? Why Anatolio Pietro, the son of a caravaneer forced into retirement because of his health and a housewife all too normal in this City? What have I got to my name other than “Azzurra's friend”?    So it's Azzurra at the end of the day."
    nvlDC"\n Of course, if these people choose not to show up, there's absolutely nothing I can do about all that."
    nvlDC"\n I shake my head and sigh again."
    nvlDC"\n And then I hear something... a sound I've never heard before."
    nvlDC"\n I look around, and into the lake. The sound repeats itself again, and I can swear I see the water's surface moving just a little. Or rather, something underneath the surface."
    nvlDC"\n And then it stops – as suddenly as it started."
    nvlDC"\n I clutch the stick in my hand as if my life depends on it, and step closer to the edge."
    nvlDC"\n No, the water is absolutely still now. Am I dreaming?"
    nvlDC"\n Again I sit down... and again the noise begins again. Like someone was swimming and purposefully raising as much noise as they could, and stopping the moment I stand up."
    nvlDC"\n And again, and again, and again."
    nvlDC"\n What in the name of the Creator is happening here?"
    nvlDC"\n Okay, Anatolio, you have to calm down. Calm down!"
    nvlDC"\n What are the possibilities?"
    nvlDC"\n Either someone is playing a prank on me..."
    nvlDC"\n Or..."
    nvlDC"\n A ghost. Or demon. Or evil spirit. Something that can snap my neck like a twig before I can scream “HELP!”"
    nvlDC"\n Either case... would it not be wise that I make myself scarce, as soon as humanly possible? In fact, that's what I'll do, right about now!"
    nvlDC"\n And then just as my back was turned to the lake..."

    " My hair stands on end."
    " Brain says “Run!”. Legs say “No can do!”. And my heart, my curious-to-a-fault heart, that has been overly excited all this while? “Stop right there”, it says."
    " I end up following the call of my heart. Perhaps that's why I am a fool."

    A" W... who goes there?"

    "I hear no answer... yet. In the meantime, my ears register the sound of water parting and someone... something emerging from the bowels of the great lake."
    "Slowly, slowly, slowly, I turn around. My grasp around the stick hardens."
    "And then my jaw drop. What... is that thing I'm seeing?"
    "Appearing before my eyes is an alien object. In the dead of night it is hard to describe the blasted thing in great detail. I can only tell it's a spherical thing, the size of a nobleman's carriage and infinitely more... fortified?"
    "And it is floating up from under the surface."
    "Then it drifts to the bank, slowly and calmly as though having all the time in the world."
    "Then it makes landfall. A portion of the sphere splits open, like a miniature sort of a drawbridge, and falls on the ground with a dull thump."
    "From deep within, something – no, someone – appears. Definitely a someone, I conclude after a second look. They have a head, a body and all four limbs..."
    "That someone nods at my general direction, then takes his very leisurely steps towards me, hands behind his back."


    A" W-who are you? What- what do you want?"

    C0" First order of business; you'd best calm down, young man."
    A" S-stop right there! I tell you!"

    C0" Though I'd rather you dispense with the big stick. I thought tonight is meant to be a time for a serious discussion, not a brawl."

    "I look at my stick, and then back at the stranger under the moonlight."
    "Even in that light, I'm not sure if I caught any detail out of the ordinary in that man. And I'm sure he's a man (if he is human, which I guess he sort of is), because of his square jaw with a rather rough-looking beard."
    "Sure, he's half a head taller than I am, and wears that merchantly bowler hat – fur coat combo that Dad's friends all have in their wardrobe one or a dozen."
    "He looks much like my father in age and demeanor: the moonlight reveals a halfway greying mass of hair and a collection of wrinkles on his forehead, just above his big bushy brows."

    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    C0" Well? What are you waiting for, my good lad?"
    A" Y-you won't hurt me, will you?"
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    C0" Do you think you'd still be around if I wished to do you harm? We are Aurora, young man. The light in the darkness, and in essence a bit of both."

    "The stick falls off my hand as if in its own accord."
    A" Y-you mean... you are Aurora? The real deal?"

    "I'm not sure if I've just become more or less calm."

    C0" Paul Attenborough, at your service. Know that today I represent the Organization before you, that's all that matters."
    A" Attenborough? Your name is... rather..."

    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa" Uncommon is the word. 'Tis the only thing keeping the likes of me linked to a time long past. Long history, great glory, that sort of things they don't like to teach these days."
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" Well, but I suppose we aren't meeting today to discuss the etymological roots of the name of my sire, no?"
    A" I... suppose so...  "

    "Another deep breath, another look to the right, and then to the left. We're alone. Good."

    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" That's a bit unnecessary. I've already taken care of the observation part for you. If any of them Church people are around in a one-mile radius, I would not have made landfall."
    A" H-how would you even know about that?"

    show Azu Paul P3 at center
    Pa" Because in the world there exists this wonderful thing called a submarine, and on that thing there's an even more wonderful thing called a periscope."
    "The man tosses a prideful look at the machine – because that's what the spherical thing turns out to be – still beaching majestically at the bank."

    A" Sub-submarine? So this is..."
    "I'm quite sure I've seen either a sketch or a rough blueprint of something to that effect in Mr. Ines' old notes. It doesn't even come close to ghosting the real deal."

    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" Actually an insignificant achievement among the many things we've done. "
    show Azu Paul P3 at center
    Pa"  Compared to those other things that Aurora has got made over the last decade or two, this machine falls into the “flashy toy for novelty's sake” niche rather than anything noteworthy."    
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    A" Is... is that true? But I've heard..."

    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" Heard that we're apostates, thugs, charlatans and outlaws who don't care about such a thing as the Creator, His Court, and therefore devoid of all morality. "
    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa"  Giving up the Creator's infinite mercy, searching for a world that doesn't exist. That what you mean?"
    A" I, well, I wouldn't actually go that far."
    "Hanes would, knowing him, but not me. I don't have the sort of objective data I would like to have before passing judgement on such an alien thing as Aurora. And most of all, it is hardly like me to commit too much brainpower to studying the relics of a past that doesn't quite concern me."
    "Except, well, that relic is right here, in front of me, and still going rather strong at that."

    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" Well, but to an extent – from a certain point of view – the Church would have been right, labeling us so."
    A" I beg your pardon? I'm not sure I get it – then what is Aurora?"
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" Lots of things. But I'll tell you what we are not, because that is relevant to why you and I are even meeting here in the first place."
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" We're not an united, structured regimens like the Church. We're a conglomeration of free people. We are independent in our thoughts and deeds, in our beliefs and preferences, and only in a very broad ideology do we find a common standpoint."
    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa" That common point? We're all in this together, to find 'the shape of the world'. You've certainly heard of the controversy, as well-read as you are."
    A" I think, yes? The Church... no, my father said that you believe there is a world beyond the world we live. A world beyond the horizon, if such a thing exists?"

    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" Calling it “belief” or “faith” would be denying what we do the credit it deserves."

    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" But the nature of the world is much different. We have grounds to doubt that the world we live in today is all that there is. "
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" Suffice to say, our world according to us used to be part of a greater over-world... or even still is."
    A" H-how so?"
    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa" Think about it. Everything in this wide universe – every object, every event, every life... exist in a process rather than in a vacuum."
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" Everything has its due process and history – how it came to be, and how it has become like we know it."
    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa" Picture this: Anatolio Pietro is not born twenty."
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa"   He's been through twenty years: an infant first, then a toddler, then a curious schoolboy, an overly active teenager... and finally the fine young man as he stands before me today."
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa"  Everything that is has a beginning and a process."

    "That makes sense. Though I have to admit: If I had been born a twenty-year-old man like I am today, that would have saved us all a lot of trouble."

    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" And yet... our world doesn't have the kind of history it should have."
    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa"  We only know of our history dating back to three hundred years ago.  "
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa"  Whatever happened before that, and how the world came to be at that three-hundred-years-ago threshold... nobody knows. "
    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa" How did it form? How did the animal and plant kingdoms came to be? How did the world's geological features came to be? "
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa"  And the climate, did it stay the same or did it change? And our society, too! How did the City come to be? What factor dictated its course?  "
    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa"  Who are those people, if any, who shaped it before history was recorded? Nobody knows, nobody can answer."
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" You don't even need to be well-read to pose those “whys” and “hows”."
    A" And you want to answer those questions?"
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" That's indeed the thread that binds us."
    A" But... if it makes so much sense as you've just told me... why doesn't anyone buy it?"
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" Not a lot rather than nobody, mind you. At any rate, the reason is because... "

    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa"  The official Church stance is what we like to call  'Argumentum ad ignorantiam'. Argument in Ignorance."
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa"  We are right because nobody has proven we're wrong. Hardly sensible... or scientific."
    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa" And yet to the vast majority of the uneducated mass, the crutch that ignorance and religion provide is a pretty good one. You don't need to do. "
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa"  The Creator knows all, and decides everything in the best way there is. All you need to do is to follow the scriptures, and that's all that matters."
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" For a while now, we've been keeping an eye on people in the City who'd perhaps like to ask these questions unbidden. That means you, Anatolio. A smart boy with a love for observation. You understand what I mean."
    A" I... well, I'm flattered, but I'm not exactly a career scholar. I read because it's fun, that's all. And of late, I think Azzurra might actually be reading more than I do-"

    "Paul's hands clap."


    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" Azzurra. Azzurra Ines. That's it."
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" Pardon my rambling – a bad habit of an old bookworm. Really hard to kill. Yes, indeed, today I want to talk to you about Azzurra, that's why we're here."
    A" D-do you know something about Azzurra? Her family?"
    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa" Would you mind if I asked you first? What do you know about Azzurra? About her state of affairs?"
    A" Are Azzurra's 'family'... impostors?"
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" Intriguing. Why would you think that?"
    A" Because... well, because that's what I think. That's all."
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" Ah, and again “Faith” proves its might. "
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa"  You had no solid proof, no evidence, no basis whatsoever. Only a blind faith in the correctness of your instinct."
    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa" Sadly, though, this time around your faith is in the right place. "

    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa" Those two people claiming to be Azzurra's family? Anything but that."
    A" How do you know this?"
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" Because I know them."
    Pa" Hildegarde von Schellendorf, Ernest von Kirchoff. Some of my closest aides, and I am deeply upset that it has come to this."
    A" But why? Why did they have to resort to..."

    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa" As an organization Aurora's patience has been running dry. "
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa"  It's been many years, you see, and our people have been alternating between fighting for their own survival in a world that hates them, and finding out this ever elusive truth."
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" Hildegarde and Ernest are just two among quite a few who want to see it end by any means necessary. And I can't say I am not sympathetic."
    A" But... how does this concern Azzurra at all?"
    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa" Because Azzurra is... no, we think she may be the key that will answer our questions, for us and for the Church alike."
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" I'm not sure how much stock the Church puts in a “chaosspawn” like they've labeled her. "
    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa" I do know that Hildegarde and Ernest and their group have this rather strong belief that Azzurra might actually have within her the key to the world outside ours. Even literally so."
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" Again, a matter of “Faith”, Unreasonable, unbridled faith."
    A" If that is indeed the case... why are you even telling me this? Aren't you Aurora yourself?"
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" Think for yourself. If you were us, what would you do after we find out that precious, naked truth about what our world is?"
    A" What... exactly do you mean?"
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" What I mean is, we are scientist, and we worship the precious truth as our god – at least, that's what it appears."
    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa" But if we are to throw conscience to the four winds just for a chance at that truth. Would it be worth it? What would that make us?  "
    "Mr. Attenborough gives me a pause – for me to think. This time, my brain works well enough."
    A" I agree... sir. I don't know about that truth, or whether it's really all that it's made out to be."
    A" I do know that I'm not just going to take it if someone tries to do harm to Azzurra on my watch!"
    show Azu Paul P3 at center
    Pa" Good! That's what I want of you. That's why I sought you out."
    A" Because... you can't intervene?"
 
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" Smart man. Yes, that's it. Principles do not allow me to stand in their way myself, because from the Organization's perspective my... friends have done nothing wrong. And a few other matters, which I must beg you not to mind."
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" But you... well, you're an outsider. And if an outsider can break whatever my friends are planning, discreetly... this episode shall be over and nobody needs to be hurt."
    A" What if I... uh, fail?"
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" Then you can figure that out yourself. Hildegarde and Ernest did not go all that length to acquire Azzurra as a foster niece."
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" So, what say you?"
    "What say I? What say I? Can there be any answer other than..."
    A" I'll do it. Please tell me what I need to do!"
    "I try not to show any sort of fear. Yet my hands are still clenched into fists; my back is drenched in cold sweat."
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" I need you to help me find a couple of things in my friends' place. Of course, if you can get away with bringing Azzurra with you, that'd be even better."

    show Azu Paul P3 at center

    "Then he turns his back to me, and begins pacing towards his 'submarine' again."
    A" W-wait! Mr. Attenborough!"
    A" Why would you entrust me with all this? What if I... well, what if I decide to give this over to Father Fredo?"
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" I bet everything I have, that Anatolio Pietro's arrogance will prevent you from doing just that."
    show Azu Paul P1 at center

    "I've been flipping over the envelope for a while now."
    nvlDC"\n Within it, there are a few things: A map, three gold coins and a bronze key, all wrapped within a single note."
    nvlDC"\n    <DOCUMENT RECEIVED>"
    nvlDC"\n How long have I been sitting there like a log, or pacing about my room to the hundredth time after reading those lines?"
    nvlDC"\n My emotions are a real mess. I don't think I've ever been more afraid."
    nvlDC"\n It isn't because of Mr. Attenborough's 'affluence' or power. It is what the whole gamut of those fancy things he presented before my eyes – probably on purpose – is supposed to evoke."
    nvlDC"\n Never I mind? For real! They've been watching me, and even broke one of my plans! And now they're intervening in our lives, too."
    nvlDC"\n That's right. My life, Azzurra's life, her identity is not even half of the cause of our problems."
    nvlDC"\n We're being played like fiddles – puppets on a stage of these people's making. And by 'these people', I mean both Aurora and the Church. I am like a pawn in a game I hardly understand, much less try to turn the table."
    nvlDC"\n Of course, it is one thing being worried, and another to actually act."
    nvlDC"\n I don't put all that much stock in Mr. Attenborough's words, and I don't think anything Aurora related is completely trustworthy."
    nvlDC"\n But then, what if he is completely honest to me? What about that then? That means Azzurra is in more danger than she has ever been before!"
    nvlDC"\n Do I have a choice any more then?"
    nvlDC"\n And then there is a part of me, that childish excitable part, that apparently thinks taking part in what seems to be a scene from a detective fiction to be an incredibly delightful thing."
    nvlDC"\n Ultimately, I pocket the three coins. That's more than I've ever had in my purse. I shouldn't, in hindsight, have taken so much money from a stranger."
    nvlDC"\n But then the other half of me laughs it off. I couldn't have turned it down even if I had a mind to – I didn't know it was there until I opened the envelope."
    nvlDC"\n Besides, leaving the City so far alone for what is essentially a spy mission? I need to be very well prepared indeed."
    nvlDC"\n I begin poring over the map."
    nvlDC"\n The more I look, the more astonished I become. We are indeed living in a world far larger than I thought it was."
    nvlDC"\n History and myths over the past few generations have recorded down the land in the West and South in great details, yet the lands in the North between the Vitus and the Lucina, the derelict land, has been pretty much unmapped."
    nvlDC"\n Aurora has done this in lieu of anyone else."
    nvlDC"\n My fingers trace the map. Every detail, road, every brooks and streams, every mounds and hills, every acre of woodland... all mapped out, all properly connoted. It is almost like Aurora was declaring to the rest of our world, that this is their lands."
    nvlDC"\n In my excitement I almost gloss over a cross in the land still technically within Church control. “Schallendorf”, it reads."
    nvlDC"\n A chill runs down my spine."
    nvlDC"\n Aurora has virtually freed themselves from that existential prison we thought we've got them trapped in. Now they've become something, capable of challenging the rest of us open society."
    nvlDC"\n Do I – would I – want to be embroiled into that circle?"
    nvlDC"\n No, if I do this, I will be part of that strife, whether I want to or not."

    "Yes, that's what I have to think. I'm not doing this for myself. I do this for Azzurra (though, to be fair, three gold coins is enough to live a reasonably high life for a few weeks)."

    A" Time to be decisive, Anatolio. Right, right... decisive... decisive,,,"
    "My muttering continues until the early morning."

    nvlDC"\n Five days before the Sun Festival. I still need a proper, detailed plan."
    nvlDC"\n That does not mean I have not begun the brainstorming over the last two."
    nvlDC"\n I told my parents I'll be going to the lake to draw for the whole day. “Live a life as a child while I still technically can,” I said, and that seems fair enough. Apparently, my parents think the same."
    nvlDC"\n But then comes the problem of how I am supposed to come to that house and back. Five to six hours on foot, that's the road, and I don't think I can cover ten hours of solid walking in a day."
    nvlDC"\n If I have a horse or hitch a hike on a kind someone's carriage, I can cut it down to two to three hours. But then, imagine Anatolio the bookworm suddenly leaving the City just less than a week before the Festival."
    nvlDC"\n Yeah, that's going to raise all kinds of red flags all right."
    nvlDC"\n That's not to mention if any problem arises on the road, I would be a sitting duck. All of these issues, I've come up with no good solution throughout the past two days."
    nvlDC"\n And then I come across my nemesis – I mean, my salvation."
    nvlDC"\n You know who she is. A sassy noblewoman with hair like a stream of gold and a signature red dress."
    nvlDC"\n Elena. Elena is back as she used to, before the incident three years ago. Since the bridges reopened, she's been frequenting our part way more often."
    nvlDC"\n Normally I'd make up my mind very quickly. Run, or go talk to her, depending on (i) who she has with her, (ii) her expression and demeanor, and (iii) where exactly we are."
    nvlDC"\n Today I just don't have the mental capacity to think all that through."
    nvlDC"\n After all, she did give me one favor after another."
    nvlDC"\n Should I ignore her this time? Or not? Decisions, decisions..."
    nvlDC"\n Of course, our eyes has met before I actually make that decision."
    nvlDC"\n Elena's eyes blink. And I am a man petrified."
    nvlDC"\n Anatolio Pietro, you are busted."

    "Elena narrows her eyes mischievously, and I spontaneously breaks down in sweat."
    A" E-Elena. Didn't think you'd come to this... not-rich parts."
    "Very eloquent, Anatolio. Just very eloquent."
    E" Ana speaks strangely, doesn't he? Didn't Elena come here often back in the days? And Ana? It isn't like Ana to go shopping alone, is it?"
    "Elena stares at me, as if drilling into my eyes."
    A" I..."
    E" Is Ana all right? Ana must have caught a cold, has he?"
    "I stand still. Like a statue. Like a really awkward statue."
    A" N-no, I'm fi-"
    E" Ana does not need to hide. Elena understands Ana, doesn't she?"
    "And I'm dead. Has there ever been any one instance when I've got a secret to hide that Elena didn't figure out?"
    "But she can't do that now. Not this time. I must not let her!"
    "I must think of something, anything, and fast!"
    "I scratch my head."
    A" R-right. Here's the deal—"
    "A figurative flash of lightning courses through my brain. Why didn't I think of this earlier?"
    "I forge the most sorrowful face I can craft."
    A" -I'm just in a bit of a vise. Bit of misfortune. Would you mind if we talk a bit later?"
    "I inject a bit of my signature arrogant 'don't-pity-me' into the statement for good measure."
    "Did I manage to trick her? Or not?"
    "Now Elena's first reaction is a characteristic “Elena knows it” smile. That's just what she does – reveling in her understanding of other people's mind."
    "But then her face sinks a little."

    E" Elena thought so. But Ana needs not worry. Ana is Elena's friend, is he not?"
    "Her voice lowers, and my anxiousness rises."
    E" More than friend, right, Ana? So Ana will let Elena know what the misfortune is, won't he?"
    "Normally I'd flush red, or jump, or both. Today I'm too busy making a suitable answer."
    "What would that 'suitable answer' be, hmm?"
