    " Clank."
    " SCREECH."
    " The backdoor creaks open. The sound is just like nail on chalkboard. My head feels like imploding."
    "Better keep that thing open. I'm not going to be here for that long, anyway. Besides, I don't think I'm so willing to hear that noise more than I absolutely have to."
    "So I weave myself into the corridor. I pull out the note in my pocket: There's the basic layout of the house."
    "Just like from the outside, the house looks rather simplistic, yet clean. The windows are closed, but sunlight can still find its way in."
    "Now it's not a mansion by any stretch of imagination. There's a living room on the ground floor, plus a kitchen and two small storerooms on the same side of a corridor. "
    "A library and two bedrooms on the first floor. Just your average country house."
    "I have two missions: Find Azzurra and the paper Mr. Attenborough asked for. "
    "There's this feeling that these paper might actually have more to do with Azzurra's fate than I should like to think, but I'm not sure actually finding them is more important than finding Azzurra first."
    "Not a lot of time here. What shall I do?"
