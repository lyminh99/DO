    "There, in front of me, stands Azzurra in the flesh. She is folding her hands – and on her lips there is this kind of melancholic smile."
    "Is she waiting for me? Or wishing I wouldn't come? Or even both?"

    A" Azzurra! I... I'm worried. About you."

    Az" Mmm. I know you will"
    A" T-they... your 'relatives', did they treat you badly? Did they keep you in-"

    " I toss a glance at the discolored wall."

    Az" Not at all, no. They're keeping me, yes, but that's what I want."

    " Azzurra stares at me and giggles."

    Az" Look at you, Ana. Weren't you trying to break into my room?"

    " When she words it like that, my face suddenly flushes red."

    Az"  Would you think someone trying to keep me hidden would build such an obvious-looking secret door?"

    " Azzurra throws a meaningful glance at the kitchen. My eyes widen: There, a door I didn't know existed is left ajar. Anatolio, curious boy, poor detective, at everyone's service."
    "Then I look at Azzurra again, from top to toe. She looks amazingly well, and doesn't seem abused in any way. All that has happened to her... is that she seems to have changed."
    "Changed. I don't know how to put it better, but I can't help but feel Azzurra is now showing to me a side of her that has never existed before. Or if it has, then I was unaware of it."
    "Before me stands a mysterious and witty Azzurra... as if cloned from Elena. Completely unlike the childish Azzurra I am so used to."
    "Her eyes stare deeper, and look a little more sunken, too, as if hiding something – some invisible burden."
    "But enough looking. Time to get this done!"

    A" I came to save- I mean, to take you home, Azzurra."
    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" And why should I? And to what home?"

    " My eyes widen. Who are you, and what have you done to my Azzurra?"

    A" Why, to your home, of course! To your books, to your tea sets, and... and to all that you've left behind, and..."

    " I was going to say “and to me”. I end up not being able to spit out those words."

    A" And... I know these people aren't actually your family. Why should you stay with them, and..."
    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" It's actually quite clear. They promised me an answer."
    A" A-an answer? About what?"
    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" About this world. About the universe out there. And..."

    " Azzurra stays quite silent, as if trying to condense her vast emotions into the smallest number of words possible."

    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" About myself."
    A" Yourself? Isn't everything so clear? What needs answering any more?"

    " My argument... doesn't hold much water. A poor choice, when I'm facing Smart Azzurra right here. "
    " Then again, my mind is drawing a blank. This is just not what I'm used to. At all."

    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" So tell me. Why did all the trouble around me happen? Where did I come from? Why am I here? Why did I meet you? "
    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" Why did everything – everything – in this universe of ours happen like they did?"

    " Azzurra's eyes bore a hole in me. Then she shakes her head."

    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" These people of Aurora promised they'll give me an answer where nobody else would... or could. I help them, and help myself all the same."
    A" What are you talking about? None of these things are important! "
    A" None, you hear? It's the present that's important! Right now!"

    " Azzurra turns away, and at once I feel like I've been beaten."

    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" I've said my piece. I'm not going to change my mind."
    Az"You... need to go, Anatolio. Perhaps you think you're being a hero, but you're a hero who is not needed. You need to go."

    " And then Azzurra begins to walk towards the open door in the kitchen. I must do something - anything!"
