    T" That's the story."

    nvlDC"The old friend's story rooted Father Fredo deep in place and deep in thoughts."
    nvlDC"\n Said old friend, also his most respected senior, went by the name Tiziano Ines. He was rolling his wheelchair from behind a large crowd of rabbles. “Pass judgement” was their demand."
    nvlDC"\n And yet the scene that was playing before him, in front of the sunlight pouring into the sills, was anything but a fair trial. "
    nvl clear

    nvlDC"\n In short – and all things considered – it was but an incident of petty theft, leading to a bit of chaos that led into some further minor property damage. And yet the old priest was confused. After all, the eyes of even an eagle would wither, blur and deteriorate, come old age and less hunting."
    nvlDC"\n Back in the day, yes, under the guiding light of the Creator, he had passed so many judgments and washed away so many sins – figuratively and literally."
    nvlDC"\n Yes, the Tenets' simple lettering had spread gold before his eyes: that was simply his job."
    nvl clear

    nvlDC"\n That was, alas, also a job of thirty years before that should have been laid to rest long ago."
    nvlDC"\n Fraud and theft – petty crimes in any other circumstances, had become major offenses in the face of their peaceful life of late."
    nvlDC"\n Fredo stood still, feeling as though he had missed some details. His nervousness tickled over his toes, only fading somewhat as he turned away from the crowd. But he couldn't – he stole a glance at the girl."

    nvlDC"She was wearing a brown-grey cap, pulled down on purpose; revealing a mass of golden hair that framed the youthful visage of a girl yet very young. The golden strands fell upon pale arms covered in scratches and bruises, quivering and trembling. Her eyes, half-hidden beneath long, curved lashes, were wet and red – crying without a sound."
    nvlDC"\n She was sobbing, once every so often, then wiped her face."
    nvl clear
#------------------------------------------------


    F" Girl. What's your name?"

    " Yes, that was the issue: the girl was so delicate – if someone was to say she had been brought here by the wind itself, a few idiots would have taken it for granted."

    scene cg_2

    CG"..."

    " She didn't answer. In lieu of one, her round eyes peeked from underneath the cover of her hair, staring at the old priest."
    " Her indigo irises widened against the backdrop of eyeballs reddening from tears."


    TN" That's pointless, Father! Like we haven't tried."

    " A young man from the crowd gave a shrug."

    TN" Just send her off! Why bother asking?"

    " Another shouted."
    " Shouts and hollers rose from the faceless crowd beyond the doorway. The old priest knitted his brows."

    T" SILENCE!"

    " Old Tiziano slammed his hand on the bench, yet his attempt made little difference amidst the chaos."
    " Surrounded by shouts, screams and insults, the young girl shrunk. Her knees bent, her hands withdrew to her face."
    " Yet interspersed in the sounds she made were words. Words from a language less known, yet one the priest recognized none the less. "
    " He knelt on one knee, whispering in her ears – hesitatingly, lest someone find out a certain something he had kept hidden."


    F" Wie heißen Sie?"
    CG" Ich-Ich…weiß nicht…"

    " And so she spoke. And so, as the crowd saw, it was an answer of one kind or another."

    TN" Geez, what kind of freak is this? Hey, you – do you even SPEAK human?"

    " So said a fishmonger, his voice slurry as if just freshly lifted from a drunken fit. "
    " Somehow the pressure behind those words – in addition to the disorderly scene before him – reminded the old priest of the gravity of every word he was about to speak. "
    " The content of the exchange was, of course, relayed to the mass by the old priest himself."

    F" What's your name?"
    CG" I... I don't know."
    F" … Then could you tell me why you stole?"

    " He asked, watching his every word."

    
    CG" ..."
    F" What's wrong, child?"    
    CG" F-Father..."
    F" Don't be afraid. The Creator shall shelter you, as He does the faithful."    
    CG" I... I am not sure..."
    TN" What the heck is that? Obviously she's lying! Don't you see?"
    DD" “Yes! Yes! That's right!”"


    " came the answer from the crowd."


    TN" Here's a witch, trying to jinx us! We must lock her up!"

    " In all honesty, did the girl even deserve such language at all? While not the party harmed, "
    " that youth had just been told off by old Tiziano just now. No wonder he was more than a little miffed."
    " Father Fredo, lost in his own thoughts, merely stopped listening to him. "
    " Tiziano, on the other hand, gave him a good stare – then shook his head and returned to the little girl."
    " A butterfly slipped past the crowd, but then immediately departed. The atmosphere must have been getting too thick, even for an insect like it."
    " It had been customary that the Church would serve as a Courthouse and the Father a Magistrate if a civil court wasn't available. "
    " Yet this was the first time in a decade that custom was called upon, in an air that matched the gravity of the situation."

    CG" … I... hungry..."

    " In the end, she did speak but a few whispers. There she knelt upon the footprints of her own jailers, her eyes filled with tiredness. "
    " None of that escaped the old priest's watchful eyes."
    " Meanwhile, the crowd kept enlarging, as it was human nature to be drawn to curiosities. "
    " Which was just as well – everyone liked to watch so long as it wasn't them being held on trial for witchcraft or heresy. "
    " Let us see, they were probably thinking, what sort of warlockery she'd try on this most sacred ground?"

    PN1" Ah, so it's her! Just shy of four days ago I saw her on the street!"
    PN2" Unbelievable. So she is a witch, isn't she? Isn't she?"
    PN1" That she is! Tell you what, I was suspicious the moment I set my eyes on her, loitering at the crossroad! "

    " So went the exchange between two bakers right in the middle of the crowd – expletives censored."
    " Of that little banter Tiziano heard all. Yet he wasn't going to intervene – his friend the priest had his hands full already. "
    " He'd get to the bottom of this business in the end, but for now, a simple clearing of the throat just loud enough to silence the two lollygaggers was enough."


    F" Then... do tell me what happened."

    " The priest did not stand up, though his aged bones were beginning to ache. He land a little towards her just as she inched away from him."

    F" Fear not. I mean you no harm."

    " If some day she could live normally like a girl her age deserved to, that day was well beyond the old priest's imagination. "
 
    TN" Can't you hear what Father Fredo said, you animal?"

    CG" Ah!"

    " The girl jumped, having taken a hard kick from the offending fishmonger. Nobody – even the two most venerable figures at the forefront – knew of the boot to her back. "

    CG" F-Father... I... I don't know! P-please let me go! Please... Please just let me go!"

    " Droplets of water from seemingly nowhere fell, dropping on the aisle between the benches."
    " Empty droplets – like the girl's memory."
    " The priest, however, kept comforting the girl. As he did so, the noises from the crowd began to fade and subside."

    DD2" “Hey, is this girl truly a witch?”"
    DD2" “Eh? I heard she is a demon-spawn!”"
    DD2" “Well I don't think so.”"

    " And then the hostile talks somehow disappeared, in its place an entirely different kind of banter."

    DD2" “Mmm... I think this is possibly a misunderstanding. Isn't it clear?”"
    DD2" “Possibly. Isn't it those kids who pushed her here though?”"
    DD2" “Darn kids. Nothing better to do than causing troubles?” "

    " concluded an old man in the crowd."

    DD2" “I'll have to teach my kid a lesson this time!” "

    " said a middle-aged woman, slashing her rolling pin at the air like a sword."

    nvlDC"Thus began the tale of the nameless girl."
    nvlDC"\n All she remembered was a dark lane filled with refuse and squalor where she woke up."
    nvlDC"\n Five days she wandered the streets, seeking help and finding none. Nobody understood her tongue, thus putting her squarely in the “mad girl nobody cares about” category.    "
    nvlDC"\n So she was driven off the streets, daring to return no more and finding an unlikely shelter underneath the new De'Rovere bridge. It was sturdy and strong, enough to cover her from the blistering sun, yet did nothing to save her from the withering cold of a winter night piercing through her thin shirt, or the hunger pangs in her stomach. "
    nvlDC"\n The only way to survive, it seemed, was to join the street urchins -  lowlives, cutpurses and pickpockets."
    nvlDC"\n The exchange actually lasted for a fair bit after that, but the priest omitted the last part."
    nvl clear

    nvlDC"\n All was good, however; nobody doubted her now."
    nvlDC"\n The priest's expression remained stern and firm, while the nosy youths had already diverted their eyes elsewhere. Then they backed off, shrugged, and vanished from sight."
    nvlDC"\n Old Tiziano glanced towards the two women. He'd heard them, no doubt – they grabbed the hems of their skirt and smiled it off."
    nvlDC"\n “So that's what happened”"
    nvlDC"\n “What should we do now?” "
    nvlDC"\n “Should we punish her?” "
    nvlDC"\n While everyone was busy talking, they saw the old priest walk towards the stained glass window looking out into the open."
    nvlDC"\n Yes, the afternoon sun had peaked, dispersing the early winter chill nipping on his potted oregano."
    nvlDC"\n Ah, he thought with a sigh of relief, they are revived."
    nvlDC"\n Yes, revived. The old priest's eyes relaxed, as did his soul."
    nvlDC"\n And then he turned around, nodded at his old friend Tiziano. Such was the smile of those who had found a metaphorical rope for a metaphorical unfortunate at the bottom of a metaphorical well."
    nvlDC"\n Procedures being what they were, Father Fredo asked but a few others for further details. Then he reached for his hat, only then realizing he'd taken it off a while before."
    nvl clear

    F" I believe we all have heard enough. Accordingly, my judgement call is as such: This girl is guilty of theft – as clear as crystal."
    F" However, given her circumstances she could have hardly done otherwise. "
    F" The Creator shall turn away not those in such desperate plights. "

    " He raised his hands and exclaimed with all his vigor."


    F" We pray to our Creator, that this child be given new life, with the blessing of sacred water in His name."
    F" Oh Praise the Creator, in whose grace we are blessed with the water of life to cleanse and nourish."

    " So came the exclamations and the quiet prayers and the sermon, one wave after the other, echoing upon the sunlit stained glass. So went the cleansing ceremony."

    F" In the Creator's name, girl, your sins have been thus forgiven."

    " And so it was, that the ceremony was to end in applause and the blessed water that the priest thus poured."

#//Tiếng vỗ tay

    " He inhaled deeply and then spoke with all haste, as if fearing someone would jump in if he would but hesitate a bit."


    F" We should be forgiving of the consequences of what she did. Everything happened because of regrettable circumstances."

    F" As the Creator has forgiven, so shall we."

    " His voice was more shaky than normal. Then he looked towards the crowd at the doorway. "
    " Here and there, he saw what looked like nods of agreement."
    " Yes, many did applaud. So many that their detractors were drowned out, deprived of interest and the victory they wanted. So they left."
    " Some in the crowd who recognized one another nodded in acknowledgement, then departed silently, as if nothing of note had transpired."
    " Understanding, patience and forgiveness: that was the moment when Father Fredo stood, once again inspiring the faith of many."
    " When the last clap had settled down, the old priest reverted to his regular thoughtfulness, his hands reaching for his chin."


    F" Perhaps I will send for help, to look for this poor girl's parents. But until then-"
    T" Quite. Who shall extend their hands to her in the meantime?"

    " Old Tiziano intervened – so that his friend would not be alone."

    T" Friends, countrymen! Standing before you is a little girl, homeless, penniless and plagued with silence! If noone would take her in, well..."
    T" May Stravagantius and his ilk take you! In the name of godly mercy, Tiziano Ines call upon you all: "
    T" Would anyone grant her shelter and food and care until such a day that she would be reunited with her flesh and blood? Would anyone? Raise your hands if you would!"

    " Such was old Tiziano's style: bombastic and to-the-point. Brief. Clear. Not a second to be wasted willy-nilly. "
    " One minute passed. Then two. Then three. Then a few more. "
    " Time weighed heavily upon the snow-covered yard."

    T" Anyone?"

    " His voice was dripping with anger. A rancher he used to be in his younger days, endowing him with the kind of brutal honesty that would crush beneath its heel the discretion that someone of his age might be expected to have."
    " His call was in vain: not a single word escaped the crowd, as if he was talking to a solid bas-relief. "
    " All he heard – all they heard – were the uninterested footsteps dropping to a pianissimo and the wind blowing through the stables behind the church in a chorus of howls and neighs. "
    " Yes, the sun was but temporary: winter had come. And winter, being what it was, brought with it the endless frost no matter the time of day. "
    " Now the sun was fading from sight, the disappearing light flooding through the doorway as if desperate and helpless."

    T" Fair enough. Fair enough."

    " Old Tiziano's voice faded into a calmer tone. "
    " He diverted his energy into the wheels of his wheelchair that rolled and rolled towards the girl kneeling before the doorway."
    " There he leaned towards her, his wrinkled and weathered hands lifted towards the little girl."
    " The priest, the girl and all those present, nobody missed that scene. Yet in the end, words – fickle as they were – failed them."
    " And then old Tiziano smiled, softly and gently."
