    C0" Not a bad ending by any stretch of imagination..."
    C0" But of course. That's what I am here for."
    C0" Ha! I hope you recall how many times you have failed. It's almost a throw-your-dog-a-bone thing to see this... not turning out as bad as it could have."
    C0" That has only happened *** times. No need to overreact, is there? It isn't like you are happy were {s}{font=fonts/times_0.ttf}קוֹמֶדִיָה{/font}{/s} everything to come to an end?"
    C0" Of course. Keeping an eye on {s}{font=fonts/times_0.ttf}קוֹמֶדִיָה{/font}{/s} them is something I just like doing."

    C0" Sometimes I don't know what you have in that head of yours."
    god" Something or other. As for you, just keep moving with that happy ending of yours.."
    god" Or if you won't have that, why not go with something easier? Simpler?"
    god" Though I'm not particularly against this {s}{font=fonts/times_0.ttf}קוֹמֶדִיָה{/font}{/s} story lasting another while, just so you know."
    C0"  No need to repeat yourself a bazillion times."
    god" Do let me in on what you've got planned out. It shall be a pleasure—"
