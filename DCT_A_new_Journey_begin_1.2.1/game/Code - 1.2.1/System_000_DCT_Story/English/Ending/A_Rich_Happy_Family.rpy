    " It was about one year later that I wed Azzurra."
    "Again, talk of the town. We'd gotten rather used to the gossip by then."
    "Those who know us, however, had no surprise there. Mr. Ascenderos even joked he was surprised we didn't have a child born out of wedlock."
    "In any case, Mr. Attenborough kept his promise."
    "Aurora and their cause no longer were part of our lives."
    "My short-lived mentor only did as he promised."
    "You don't get to see too many people standing by their words these days. Especially concerning such very important matters."
    "Have I made the right choice? Some nights, under the bright moon and the starry sky, I'd think as much to myself."
    "Perhaps a younger me would have regretted that choice, but I'd made it and thus have to live with it."
    "Though often I'd think to myself: how would things have been different – not necessarily better or worse – for us had I chosen otherwise."
    "As time passes, and as my hair turns grey ever so gradually, I'd learnt how to ignore those questions, or at least keep them under check."
    "I am living in the present, not a hypothetical past."
    "More importantly?"
    "I am a family man now."

    HC" Master! Master! Young Master Emilio is... is..."

    " Well, well, well. Why am I not surprised?"

    A" What's it this time?"
    show Azu Unknow P0 at center
    HC" – having another fight, Master! Took five minutes to split him from Lord Baronet Benito De'Rovere, too!"
    C0" HANDS OFF ME! OFF, OFF, OFF! I'M TEACHING THE COWARD A LESSON!"
    A" By the Creator, what's going on here, Emilio?"

    " He stares at me, my boy... and then back on the floor the moment his gaze meets my. "
    "That's my kid: stubborn and fearless to everybody but Azzurra and I. More specifically, I."

    Emi"  Father, I..."

    " Sometimes I ask myself why."

    Emi"  I... I'm sorry, Father."

    " It's like a kind of gift granted from above. And not entirely unneeded, mind you. Controlling a hot-headed boy about to become a young man is hard work."

    A" Look at yourself now. Ours isn't a ruffian's clan, we're educated gentle folks!"
    A" Hardly becoming of my son, getting down and dirty and all. Agree?"

    nvlDC" Educated gentle folks?"
    nvlDC"\n Funny how time changes. The son of a small, insignificant merchant, after fifteen years, what have I got for myself?"
    nvlDC"\n I won't be so arrogant to say “The whole neighborhood belongs to me”. But that wouldn't be so far from the truth."
    nvlDC"\n Except for Mr. Ascenderos' house, which I made a point to never touch, I've basically bought off every other house, businesses and shop fronts around me, and remake our old street into something of a production center."
    nvlDC"\n The Merchants' Guild approves. Business is good, and where there is business there is wealth."
    nvlDC"\n As for Azzurra, after the ceremony her ill-deserved reputation was finally fixed for good. If the Creator Himself accepts her, they say, what can the average person on the street say but do the same?"
    nvlDC"\n Perhaps Father Fredo is the only one who only lost rather than gained anything out of the whole business. He has retired, for good this time, and retreated to a run-down chapel in a remote village at the edge of civilization."
    nvlDC"\n All signs, he told me once, points to a new era beginning. And he wants to be no part of it. I didn't know what he truly meant then, but now?"
    nvlDC"\n Perhaps he is right, but not for the reason he thought. The City is now a place of business and commerce."
    nvlDC"\n After so much trouble we've gone through the Church and the City authorities had agreed to keep the bridges open. That helps traffic, that helps business, and that helps the Church look better. Everyone benefits. "
    nvlDC"\n I've got the new Pope to thank for that: one day he proclaimed something about doing the very best to make sure those who want to do business can do so. Again, the Merchants' Guild approves."
    nvlDC"\n As time passes, the rank of merchants in the City begins to soar, swelled by the new class of nobles who decided their money is better invested in workshops and plantations rather than in expensive toys that do nothing but look pretty."
    nvlDC"\n A soft harrumph from my assistant brings me back to reality. There, my boy stands, cowed... yet still stubbornly staring into the distance – at anything that isn't me."

    Emi" But, Father! He started it! Said you're not as great as his dad! That his dad will crush you in a fair fight! "
    Emi" That-that-that I'm a third-rate soldier who'd eat a cannonball to the face before a battle even begins!"

    " Oh dear. Let's just say he got his hot-headedness from somewhere. Not necessarily a bad thing, if I have to say that myself. Just look at me today."
    A"There will be no battle. We've been through this, son."
    Emi"  But he said there will be! A big, huge, enormous war's coming, that's what he said! That he'd be a real hero when the opportunity comes!"

    " I shake my head. The De’Rovere clan is truly exceptional at everything, except at bringing up a child properly. "
    "Let's just say having a hussar officer for a father did make the boy something of a swagger and a thug."

    Emi" Father? Say something!"
    A" Look, Emilio. Like I said: he's a boy born of a noble family, and with a father in the cavalry? "
    A"Of course he'd fancy himself a better-than-you warrior."

    " Benito De'Rovere, well, what can I say about that boy? Kid's a De'Rovere scion, and probably pretty high in the Duke's line of succession, true, but he's not Elena's son."
    "Not long after our emancipation Elena vanished without a trace. Nobody knows what happened, and – though quite rightly depressed, the Duke said nothing about the matter."
    "Some year later they say the Duke adopted a distant relative, and has been treating this lady as though his own daughter."
    "All of this, of course, is hearsay: with Elena gone, I no longer have a trustworthy source of information on the goings-on in the noble world."
    "What is definitely not pointless gossip, is that this foster daughter of the Duke took a husband who is a cavalry officer. A typical cavalry officer."

    A" And us? We aren't military stuff, son. My father, his father before him, and his father before that too, we've made our living buying low and selling high. "
    A" And do some reading in the sideline if we have the time. Not fighting, and definitely not being a hero of any sort."

    " How my boy got to know the De'Rovere grandson is... well, a mystery to me. "
    "There's something between them that reminds me very strongly of Hanes and myself – with my own son playing the Hanes part."
    "I suppose someone can make a bold statement about karma right here."

    A" Now I'm not saying you can't hang out with him, but you have to know who he is and who you are. Got it, son?"
    Emi" But that's giving up! That's cow-cowardice!"

    " My eyes flare. And my boy shivers."

    Emi" Father, I-"

    " Deep breath, Anatolio. Deep breath, and soften yourself."

    A" That's not cowardice. That's what I call being a wise man who knows who he is and acts accordingly. And you'd do well to learn how."
    A "Learn to keep calm. Learn to take things in stride. Learn how not to explode every single time. It's a skill like any."
    " I pat him on the shoulder."

    A"Would you look at the time! Back to your room, get changed, and prepare for tonight's reception."
    
    "Emilio shuffles out of the room, eyes still wandering somewhere on the floor."
    "I'm not sure what it is that bothers him more: that I've once again told him to basically know his place, or the event tonight."
    "As for the event tonight?"
    "Now the main character enters my study."
    "Blue dress (except of fine silk rather than coarse threadbares), check. Golden hair, check (except now nicely combed with a silver hairpin)."
    "And a pair of twinkling eyes: thoughtful and mischievous in equal measures (except with that motherly concern about it)."
    "Yes, that's my Azzurra all right. Azzurra – the more she changes, the more she stays the same."
    "Azzurra might be the oddest lady among the new upper class. And I am so proud about it."
    "Fifteen years has made Azzurra into not just my wife, not just the mother of my son, but also my closest ally and assistant."
    "The only one I can trust, come what may. Much of what I have today, I wouldn't have earned without her support, or her acumen, or her attitude."

    AZ" That's... not going to be the end of that, I'm afraid, dear."
    A" Not much we can do about that, is there? Kid's as stubborn as a mule. Just give him some time to think it over."
    AZ"Says the proud father."
    A"Guilty as charged."

    "I am not sure my chuckle helps matter, because Azzurra just raised an eyebrow at me. And maybe shook her head in that mild, Azzurra-ly disapproval, too."

    AZ" Oh, and about tonight... Do you think he should attend with us?"
    A" Ah, he'll manage. We aren't going to be around forever, sooner or later he'll have to do everything for himself. "
    A" That means he'll have to start getting lessons on how to hold receptions and get contracts signed sooner or later."
    A"Preferably sooner."
    show Azu A P4 at center
    AZ" I'll see if I can do something to help him…"
    A" Make sure to hurry – this is your contract we're discussing, not mine!"

    " All told, I'm rather pleased by the reception."
    "We didn't get the contract signed , but that's a mere technicality at this point. The would-be clients seem to like what they see – our little trade empire, how professional Azzurra is, and how everything runs like oiled clockwork between us."
    "And then there's Emilio, too: he can look like (or even be) a good apprentice to the trade if he wants, and this night he'd been sitting there, patient and smiling and as observant as you can hope."
    "Now, as the servant closes the gate and the household winds down, I – we – return to our regular schedule."
    "It's been two years now since we built ourselves this small mansion as befitting our new wealth and status."
    "Not one day has gone by without Azzurra and I climbing to the top floor balcony every sunset."
    "We've got everything there that makes us who we are: Azzurra and I, immersed in the fresh air, the fading sun and the horizon before our eyes."
    "We'd sit there for an hour a day, until the sun vanishes behind the thin horizon. Discuss what business of the day we need to, or talk about some distant scientific matter irrelevant to our new life."
    "Good entertainment, if nothing else."

    " Today, Azzurra seems more quiet than she normally is."

    A"  What's the matter, dear? Something on your mind?"
    show Azu A P5 at center
    AZ" You're right. Something's on my mind – nothing serious though."
    A" How about we talk about it?"
    A" Let me guess. Emilio?"
    show Azu A P0 at center
    AZ" Not really, no. Emilio... well, he's a lot more... proper, than he shows everyone. Give or take a few years and I'll have nothing to worry."

    " Read my mind, Azzurra. I've never been quite concerned about my boy. "
    "Now, Benito De'Rovere, on the other hand, I'm more concerned about, and I'm not even that kid's father."

    A" Is it about this contract then?"
    show Azu A P3 at center
    AZ" I wouldn't even think about it if I were you. "
    show Azu A P4 at center
    AZ" I'm not Azzurra Pietro if they don't drag a nicely done-up contract here in a few days begging for a signature!"

    " Again, read my mind."

    A" What is it then?"
    show Azu A P1 at center
    AZ" My dreams."
    A" Oh? I thought it's been a while since you last had a nightmare?"
    show Azu A P0 at center
    AZ" It has."
    AZ" I've only been thinking... how the last fifteen years have gone by like a dream."
    A" A very pleasant dream, I sure hope?"
    show Azu A P6 at center
    AZ"  …"
    A" … D-did I say something wrong?"
    show Azu A P0 at center
    AZ" No, nothing wrong, dear. It's been a beautiful dream. Just that..."
    show Azu A P3 at center
    AZ" … It is also incomplete."
    AZ" So many questions we have left unanswered."
    show Azu A P0 at center
    AZ" So many mysteries, unaddressed."

    " Azzurra looks up at the sky above. Up there, the sun is sinking behind the mountain range in the distance."
    "The dying light shines upon our City, draping it in gold and amber. What a beautiful painting, more so than any artist can hope to capture."

    AZ" You may have forgotten how we, too, were also curious as to what lies beyond that sky..."
    A" I haven't. Not for a day. But..."
    show Azu A P1 at center
    AZ" But?"
    A" There are things, my dear Azzurra, that are simply out of our reach."
    A" The Anatolio Pietro, Esq. today only has enough time and energy for two things. One is to ensure this business of ours continue to prosper and grow. And two..."
    A" Two: To make an elegant lady named Azzurra and a stubborn young man named Emilio happy."

    " Azzurra smiles."
    AZ" I've never once doubted that. But then, if not us, who would be able to reach those mysteries? Emilio's generation?"

    A" Most likely not even his. Perhaps his children, or his children's children. Who knows?"
    A" I think... maybe if a time comes when this world becomes too crowded and stuffy. Maybe if the Church and the existing order can no longer handle everything."
    A" Then there will be people who are good and smart and resourceful enough to answer those questions we have been unable to."
    A" If anything... we're just unfortunate not to be born in those times. That is one thing completely beyond what I can do."
    AZ" Actually... no. No, we aren't unfortunate."
    A" Oh?"
    show Azu A P5 at center
    AZ" Do you recall what you've told me before?"
    AZ" If we can't reach for that horizon so distant, if we can't answer all those questions beyond our scope, why not look after our own happiness? "
    AZ" That's what you said, wasn't it? To treasure what we have in hand, rather than the distant things you cannot help."
    show Azu A P4 at center
    AZ" You remember, don't you?"
    A" Of course!"

    " How can I not? It is the very logic that helped me save Azzurra and myself. The very thing that brought us together."
    "We are standing right here, looking at the world from the top floor of just about the tallest building in this part of the city, and the sky above it. "
    "All of this would have been impossible had we not followed that simple philosophy."

    show Azu A P2 at center
    AZ" That's why... I have no regret whatsoever."

    " My eyebrows twitch. Were I a teenage boy like back then, I'd make like “Girls are so complicated”. "
    "Well, but today I'm no longer a teenage boy, and that women is no longer my friend-student-girl-I-am-attracted-to."

    A" Wait up, weren't you the one going “those last fifteen years have been a pleasant dream, but incomplete”?"
    show Azu A P4 at center
    AZ" I did. And there's no contradiction whatsoever."
    AZ" Because why care about completeness when we've got the most important thing?"

    " Azzurra holds my hand tight. “Family”, she whispers, and everything suddenly becomes clear.  "
    "We are imperfect, and that is why we get to be together, and prosper: because we have put our effort into that which matters."

    A" My thoughts exactly. That's all we want. That's all we need."
    show Azu A P5 at center
    AZ" Indeed."

    "Let's try this again."
    "Let's do that. Bring up the boy properly. Because, Emilio, you're my hope. You're our hope, and our future."
    "That's right, That which our generation could not do, perhaps our children can. If they can't, then perhaps their children, or their children after them."
    "Because human society is here to stay. And to stay means to grow."
