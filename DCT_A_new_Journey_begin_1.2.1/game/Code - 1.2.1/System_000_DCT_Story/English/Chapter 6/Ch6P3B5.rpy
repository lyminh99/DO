    Az"  And most importantly... you disappeared a few days ago for the whole evening. You told nobody. If you had nothing to hide, why do that?"

    " I wipe the sweat off my brows."
    "Okay, let's be frank. Let's be frank. Even if I've made up my mind to tell her the truth, her repeated hammer blows still shocked me to the core."
    "How much does she know about everything"

    A"  …"
    A" I admit. I have spoken to them, but I'm not part of their group."

    " To be completely honest I'd have to say “not yet”, But for the sake of the discussion, I don't think Azzurra would appreciate such unnecessary details."

    A" Long story."
    show Azu P45 at center
    Az" And you don't want to tell?"
    A" I'm not sure it would be... beneficial for you to know everything?"

    " Azzurra's gaze drills into me."

    show Azu P53 at center
    Az" If you say so – why don't you start with what you're sure would be beneficial for me?"

    " She beams. Mysteriously. Oh dear me."

    show Azu P54 at center
    Az" The rest... I can fancy a guess or two."

    " … what bizarre world am I in, and is it my dear Azzurra or an Elena clone in front of me?"
    "Either way, have I a better choice?"

    A" Very well. Very well. I'll say. I'll say what I can."

    " Of course that means “not everything”. I did tell her about Mr. Attenborough. About our meetings. About what he wanted of me. About what Aurora has to do with what we've gone through, and how it saved us (so to speak) from a fate rather worse than death."
    "And most importantly, about the decision I have till this weekend to make."
    "A long breath is all I can manage when it ends."
    "I feel like collapsing on the table, exhausted yet strangely liberated."

    A" And the rest, your guess is probably as good as my confession."
    A" Azzurra... what would you have me do?"
    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" What... I would have you do?"
    A" That's the question! What would you like me to do? To join them? Or to turn them down?"

    " Azzurra shakes her head."

    Az" You've done so much for me. How can I ever ask for more?"
    A" Hey, can the formality? I've said it: You're important to me. So,,,"

    Az" No. I can't do that."

    Az" You're putting a huge burden on my shoulder, Anatolio."
    A" It's not! I really want you to-"
    show Azu P53 at center
    Az" Well, think of it this way. If I told you to go ahead, what if something goes really, really wrong down the line because you've done as I said?"
    show Azu P54 at center
    Az" Or what if I told you not to, and some time down the line you start to regret that opportunities you've missed, again because you've done as I said?"
    show Azu P53 at center
    Az" That's not my burden to bear, Anatolio. I can't. I dare not."
    A" But this is your opportunity to meet those who can answer your questions! As your colleagues, rather than people who'd experiment on you!"
    A" Your questions you so wanted to ask! Why you're here. Why everything happened as they did. What is out there waiting for us."
    A" You said you wanted to know, didn't you?"

    " She did, and I am sure she'd like those answers more than anyone. Otherwise she wouldn't have done, well, basically everything she had over the past month."
    "But she shakes her head."

    show Azu P52 at center
    Az" You're right. I do. I do want those answers, so badly, and I don't think I'll ever not want them."

    Az" But..."

    " Her cheeks flare a little."

    Az" You said I'm important to you, didn't you? How can I just chase after my selfish desire and not care about how you feel?"

    Az" I'll say this much: I'll always support you. Stand by your side. And walk with you. To wherever."

    Az" I... have made myself clear... I hope?"

    " Then she turns away. Her mass of golden hair hides her burning cheeks rather well."
    "Took me a few seconds to understand what exactly going on."
    "Well, well, well. Hi there, proposal-Azzurra-style?"
    "That's right. I've done exactly what Azzurra said she wouldn't do to me: chase after my own thoughts, and forget about how she feels."

    A" ..."
    A" Message received. L-loud and clear."
    A" S-so, you w-wouldn't hold it against me if..."

    " Azzurra turns around now, with cheeks less red but eyes way brighter. She'd made that most important choice in her life."

    show Azu P32 at center
    Az" Not now. Not ever."
    A" So..."

    Az" Please... think this over carefully. Whatever your choice, whatever happen... I'll be there. I'll be there for you. No matter what."

    " I clench my fist."
    "Right, time to make a decision! Time to make up your mind once and for all, Anatolio!"

    A" I've decided."

    " Azzurra's eyes widen."

    A" Time's money!"
