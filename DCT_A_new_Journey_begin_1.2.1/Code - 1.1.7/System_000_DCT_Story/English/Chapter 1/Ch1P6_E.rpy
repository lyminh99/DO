    H" Y-you should have l-let me see you home."
    A" Thanks, but no thanks. This here's far enough. Let me be the only one sworn to carry the burden of our lady friend's weight."

    H" Haha. M-makes sense."

    "Here's what happened. Just after a round of applause and celebration, Azzurra, being who she is, kind of fell unconscious. "
    "Asleep. She scared us for all of five seconds, until we realize she was simply nodding off. Without that, well, I might have carted her to the nearest clinic."
    "But then, well, not all's well for good old Anatolio. As it happens, it's up to me to carry her. "
    "Forty-something kilos isn't much, but carrying that weight over that distance between the cathedral and our neighborhood kind of is."
    "After waving Hanes goodbye, I hear the church bell strike eleven in the evening. "
    "I quietly thank the Creator that I've remembered to tell them beforehands where I was going. If not..."

    H" Do r-remember our business!"

    "File that under 'Hanes being Hanes' for me, please."

    A" Right, right, right."

    "I shout, not even turning back."
    "What business, you ask?"
    "Seems like I have been talked into a meeting at the church with Hanes about the group's future experiments in his room. "
    "I can't say I'm terribly thrilled, but then, well, what's done is done."
    "Hanes is taking this extremely seriously. Should I do something to prepare for this meeting?"
    "Or not. I swear my joints are threatening to fall off their sockets."

    "The second De'Rovere bridge across the Iovis is the most practical (and to us, the only) thing connecting the cathedral and the rest of the city. "
    "From one side of the bridge, you can see the splendid light from the first bridge of that name, leading to the northern landmass."
    "So there stand the bridges, three in total, like a triangle across the three rivers connecting the three landmasses. "
    "That is a kind of symbol of this good city of ours, and a good successor as any to the Crooked Geezer of old."
    "I was wondering, if we are to look at them from the bird's eye, what would they look like? A perfect equilateral triangle, "
    "or just an ugly mess? Well, if I could, I'd like to do that one day."
    "Maybe, just maybe, Mr. Ines' notes have something in them I can use to make a pair of wings or something."

    Az" Yaaaawn..."

    " The girl perched on my back have apparently awakened. She rubs her eyes, sounding groggy still."

    A" Sleeping princess' awaken?"

    Az" Uhhh... But I wanna... go back to sleep. What a warm pillow... zzzz..."

    " Yes, there she goes again. My back's not a pillow, for your information."
    "Or is she actually asleep?"

    Az" Hey Ana..."

    " Azzurra whispers into my ears."

    A" Eh?"

    Az" I... was dreaming."
    Az" I was dreaming about a golden field of sand. An endless field, with no destination in sight."
    Az" I was going and going and going, aiming for the horizon... and it remains far and away from my reach."
    A"  ……………"

    Az" What do you think there is in that desert?"
    A"  Is there anything but sand in a desert?"

    Az" Eh... no. I... I saw my mother there."
    show Azu P53 at center
    Az"  I know, right? Wherever I go, my mother follows. Taking care of me, a little at a time. That's what I... feel, anyway. She loves me.  "
    show Azu P54 at center
    Az" I might have grown up now, but she's there with me still. When I eat, when I go play, when I study, when I sleep. The flowers, too... she brings me those as well!"
    A"  Azzurra, that's just a... dream. A figment of your imagination. You were... you miss your parents, that's all that it is."

    "Poor Azzurra. I can't imagine being in her shoes."

    show Azu P42 at center
    Az" Hey, Ana."
    A" What is it?"

    Az" Maybe I... do you think I'll get to see my parents again?"
    A"  Azzurra…"

    "The damp night breeze washes upon my face. "
    "This time of the year, the wind often carries with it dust and sand – maybe that's why me eyes are all grainy and watery now. "
    "I want to answer Azzurra, but then all I have is an empty encounragement. Not much different than putting ice on an open wound. "
    "It dulls the pain, but only for a moment. Only for a moment, it does."
    "“I'm always on your side, Azzurra.”"

    "From then on, it took us no time to get back home. I can see the light from my house's window. Mom's waiting."

    Az" I'm going home. You, too."

    "Azzurra folds her arm, her sleepy voice and demeanor doesn't look very much like a grown woman at this point."

    A" Well then. Good night, Azzurra."

    "Azzurra yawns as she walks off. Her hairband has now fallen off, leaving her hair flowing in the moonlight."
    "… why the hell am I blushing again?"
    "I know only to scratch the back of my head, and march into the door now held ajar."

    "When I reach the main street, the figure has... gone. Like a ghost dispersing into the shadow whence it came. "
    "Now that I think about it... I didn't see their feet touching the ground, too."
    "“Was that a ghost, for real?”"
    "I am doused now in cold sweat."
    "I don't know what I'm doing, but I spent the next half an hour searching the remaining lanes and turns in sight, and found nothing. "
    "Not even a footprint."
    "It took my mom calling me back to break me from my feverish trance. I walk back, turning around once every so often. "
    "If the figure's still around... I don't want them into the house with me."
    "And so the night comes to a close... with my heavy heart and the flickering light of the late oil lamp."
