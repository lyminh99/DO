    " Comes over to my place often, too. I have been no stranger to his tomato-red nose. Borrowing money, most of the time.  "
    " So-called 'borrowing', anyway. A drunkard like him, well, it's less 'borrowed' and more 'beg' – you don't expect payback for that.  "
    " Whether he remembers his 'debt' or not is anyone's guess. Right, his name. Uncle Ascenderos, isn't it? "
    " Again, how he got himself a bookstore to his name is anyone's guess. Two kiosks, actually – looks bloody fine if you asked me.  "
    " Anyway, I'm not going to envy the guy. No sir, not at all.  "
    " Of course, there are things like this that I'm just not going to forget. "

    nvlDC" Like I said, one can ask for little more."
    nvlDC"\n The Inner City is a mite more complicated so to speak, but all in all, everything's good. Buildings were built back to back, leaving us a few major avenues, a larger number of streets, several little lanes, and a couple cul-de-sacs buried behind rows of bricks and mortar."
    nvlDC"\n Even the roads themselves are rarely straight, but twist and turn like a strangled python. Strangely enough, all of these put together form a perfect urban picture.Like an abstract painting: hard to understand, but you can't really complain."

    nvlDC"As the rumors go, hidden deep in the Church's libraries, there are certain books. Mysterious books, found by certain people."
    nvlDC"\n They were hidden away, but not so flawlessly as to be completely dashed from the mortal world."
    nvlDC"They tell of the world."
    nvlDC"\n That world, as it goes, has many names. To some, it is Terra. To others, it is Gaea. To others still, it is Humus, or Eorthe, or Joro... there are perhaps as many names as there are drops of water in the world."
    nvlDC"\n That inconsistency is because that world is essentially an intangible thing, or an invisible metaphor, or some kind of deity beyond the mortal ken."
    nvlDC"\n They even say that above that Terra – for consistency's sake – is an even more endless and unfathomable space: Kosmos – or “the universe”, as someone has translated it into the language of man for me. "
    nvlDC"\n That Kosmos, he said, contains everything that there is: from the minuscule grain to the vast infinity that man is not meant to know."
    nvlDC"But then, man, being man, are wont to imagine. "
    nvlDC"\n Things like the dazzling lightning bolts, or dusk and dawn, or any number of phenomena... All of them can be explained in a logical, scientific and rational manner, yet have long been turned into tales of spirits and ghosts and deities and demons. "
    nvlDC"A testimony, perhaps, to the imagination of the man who tells the story?"
    nvlDC"\n Well, the books tell too of tales of certain people, like Faraday, or Nobel, or Tesla and Edison, or Einstein – the geniuses; and the likes of Nero, or Bathory, or Vlad the Impaler or Ivan the Terrible, or Hitler and Franco... a multitude of men of incredible brutality and madness."
    nvlDC"Born in an imagined plane of existence, maybe? So I do hope."
    nvlDC"\n Most of all, as in the Holy Scripture and its many parables, the number of tales these books imply seems endless, too, as are their variants."
    nvlDC"\n They will remain endless, the readers thought, until they could actually find that Terra."
    nvlDC"\n My late grandfather, when he was alive, used to tell the story of a certain group of intellectuals. There was an incident, he said, when they destroyed an entire building block and the city walls around it. Trying to free the world, it seemed, from its walls – even today it seems to be a terribly irrational thing to do – in search of the things on the other side."
    nvlDC"\n They call that incident  – Mane cruentum – “Bloody morning”, and not without reasons."
    nvlDC"Thirty eight souls were extinguished that day, by their own hands or others', their remains intertwined in the debris of idealism and truth."
    nvlDC"And then, when the final piece of shattered masonry fell from that block, that once tallest tower of the city, mingled with the blood-red stream of faith..."
    nvlDC"They said the remaining touched one thing that they should not have been able to."
    nvlDC"THE SKY ITSELF."

    nvlDC" The story shifted, then, into one of the idle hands."
    nvlDC" That's what they said about the events that then transpired."
    nvlDC" The Church, until that moment silent, began to denounce the books. It took them no time to take the books off the shelf and cart them into the long list of heretic texts to be locked up and never again see the light of day."
    nvlDC" Yet the belief in the Kosmos theory persisted."
    nvlDC" Like caged birds ever striving for freedom, that group had within their folds intellectuals and merchants and other people of significance alike. "
    nvlDC" They called themselves “Aurora”, or “Dawn”. A great name, all things considered."
    nvlDC" The next few decades were, according to the clergy, the darkest hours of mankind yet. "
    nvlDC" Nature was enraged: there were wildfires, there were floods, there were droughts, there was a great plague, even. Yet men, in their infinite wisdom, were squabbling among themselves about things no one could yet prove."
    nvlDC" Pure, undiluted idiocy."
    nvl clear

    nvlDC" “STOP!”"
    nvlDC" So cried a certain young man, who proved beyond a shadow of doubt the infinite power of the almighty Creator. "
    nvlDC" A voice, like a hammer blow, smashing and silencing all voices that spoke otherwise."
    nvlDC" Thus ended the debate in such a manner: quiet and noiseless. That priest, hailing from a peaceful, illustrious family and the name of a leader, had severed the mass from the demagoguery of the stubborn faithless."

    nvlDC" “Should you find a conclusive evident, the Church and the common man will believe you.”"
    nvlDC" Thus it was by their own razor that the priest laid low the haughty, so they had little choice but to agree."
    nvlDC" Such was the might of Occam's razor, that it took but a few weeks to work its magic."
    nvlDC" Aurora, the movement of those seeking to reach for the skies, shrank and faltered by its own self. Without the popular support it counted on, they faded away – though the next few years did see a number of clashes and battles, none so significant as to leave a mark on the world."

    nvlDC" Here a quote from a long gone philosopher would suffice: “The sun has risen, and the radiant dawn at the end of its mission”. Indeed, the Dawn has faded, in its place the brilliance of the Noontide."
    nvlDC" It was not for want of effort, too: in trying to answer the priest' challenge, the men and women clinging onto the faith of the world 'outside' and the desire for true freedom searched far and wide, within the city and without. The only fruit they harvested, however, was despair."
    nvlDC" As the days and months and years came to pass, their faith vanished also, as if having found their final resting place with the vague scent of the anemone flower in the eventide."
    nvlDC" Then the books, too, vanished without a trace, be it in the minds of men, or in reality itself."
    nvlDC" They said the Church had, contrary to its nature, burnt them all. Nobody bothered to verify their fate."
    nvlDC" The people know that these tall tales – the rumors – had lost its only respite. They belong in the shadows now, where they shall remain harmless."
    nvlDC" Then the city, as it deserves, returned to its peaceful self as has been for years before."
    nvlDC" It is as if man's ego has never been ready for such a catastrophic loss of that eternal peace. "

    nvlDC" I never seem to come to this place all that frequently. "
    nvlDC" Makes sense: if you had a small homestead in a small neighborhood on the other side of the river where everyone knew everyone else, it would be hard to imagine that just a short distance away there was such a contrasting scene, of men and of vehicles and of goods."
    nvlDC" I come back to my world – the place I have been to this morning, from my vantage point, looks like a grain of corn in the horizon. "
    nvlDC" The storm, it seems, has passed. Time to go home for good."
    nvlDC" There, in a quiet corner, is the home of your sincerely. We have a small fruit stall that also diversifies into minor sundries and haberdasheries. Nothing special, in other words."
    nvlDC" Maybe it is my mother's kindly nature – or perhaps rather the needlessly colorful signboard at the front (I swear, that was NOT my idea). "
    nvlDC" Fact of the matter is, business is good, and so is my family coffer."
    nvlDC" That's the reason why I – unemployed as I am – have the luxury to loiter around most of the time. Well, I'm not really unemployed, as I have yet to truly come of age. "
    nvlDC" Not that “not yet of age” prevented quite a few of my friends finding work, anyway."
    nvlDC" But then I'm an artist-cum-scientist. Self-proclaimed, true, but it is still something I have to say in my defense, am I right?"

    nvlDC"\n The girl laughed, as if singing a most exquisite song."
    nvlDC"\n And yet the two sounds could not break that wall between them and the ears of passers-by. Like automatons made of bronze and steel they walked past, eyes empty as if devoid of souls."
    nvlDC"\n That was alright, wasn't it? Everything would come to an end, whether or not anyone did anything, wouldn't it?"
    nvlDC"\n Observe!"
    nvl clear

    nvlDC"\n The weeping was growing quieter. Had the girl grown used to it?"
    nvlDC"\n The laughters was growing lower. Had the girl grown bored?"
    nvlDC"\n Oh, bless the fortunes: footsteps are coming!"
    nvlDC"\n {i}Whose footsteps?{/i}"
    nvlDC"\n -  The boy's."
    nvlDC"\n {i}Whose footsteps?{/i}"
    nvlDC"\n -  The kids are running off."
    nvlDC"\n {i}Whose footsteps?{/i}"
    nvlDC"\n -  Nobody's."
    nvlDC"\n {i}What a killjoy! {/i}"
    nvlDC"\n A mass of hair flowed. The girl looked up."
    nvlDC"\n A hand extended. And so they met."

    nvlDC"\n Fast as the cymbals of the children playing mock parade, the afternoon comes."
    nvlDC"\n If I am to stay indoors, the cool breeze from outside falling upon the window sill would make me drowsy.  "
    nvlDC"\n Rather than sitting like a man bored out of his wits next to the pile of books, I stand up. Time for a walk – health accompanies activity, so has my Dad said."
    nvlDC"\n As the day fades away, the streets in the city also grows less busy. Now's the time the ordinary person would prepare to rest."
    nvlDC"\n What few stalls and kiosks that remain in the marketplace are closing down. Even the stray dogs on the streets are withdrawing to the shadowy lanes, their litters in tow."
    nvlDC"\n I wonder if the little puppies would catch a cold. They were stray pups, after all, their furs dripping with rain water from the passing drizzle."
    nvlDC"\n If she were here, she'd leap towards them and hold them in her arms."
    nvlDC"\n This is also the time for the taverns and inns to spring to life. I'm just about seeing scattered lights lighting up corners here and there against the sunlight, like pairs upon pairs of owls' eyes."
    nvlDC"\n Some travelers are leading their steeds into the stables, just as some others readying for a night's journey."
    nvlDC"\n The quiet streets rarely ever lend themselves to changes."
