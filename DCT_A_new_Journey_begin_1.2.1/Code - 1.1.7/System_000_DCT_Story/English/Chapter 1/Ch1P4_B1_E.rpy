    "When I got home, Azzurra was already there. But then-"

    A" What happened to you?"
    "Her face was smudged with dust and dirt."

    "Raspberry cake with sesame. Azzurra's trademark favorite food."
    "I've been around her for long enough; if I didn't know what she fancies every time she drools in front of the bakery, well, I'd be a terrible friend."
    "But then again-"

    A"  I'll ask you three questions first. No answer, no cake."

    A"  Question one: Did Elena pay for your book?"
    AZ" ……"
    AZ"  Question two?"
    A"  Since when did you know each other?"

    "I was a little jealous, truth be told. Elena has never treated me so well as this one time she treats Azzurra."

    AZ"  Question three?"
    A"  Answer all at once if you like"
    A"  Why did you hide it from me? "
    A"  Both the book and Elena?"

    A" Four, my dear Azzurra? That's three!"
    show Azu P21 at center    
    AZ" Let me spell it out. One, “did Elena pay for me”. "

    AZ"  Ahaha, gotcha! It's mine now!"
    A"  Now where's the femininity in snatching food like that?"

    "I've just been pushed to the ground, for your information. As for the cake... well, it's Azzurra's now. Pristine as new."

    "I shrug. Not much I can do about that – that's why I'm a nice guy."

    A"  You mean you don't know anything about it?"
    show Azu P21 at center
    AZ"  I've just told you! I don't know, that means I don't know!"

    "After sacrificing two hours and a good cake for the business, Azzurra's answer is... she has nothing to do with Elena paying for the book."
    "As for her dirtied face, she said she tripped and fell. Certainly something behind this is fishy."
    show Azu P29 at center
    AZ" I haven't even talked to Elena before."

    "In short, “I don't know”. That's her final answer."

    A"  But that is... odd. Why did Elena say she'd paid for you? Could she be lying?"

    "No, that makes little sense. Elena was full of herself. Either she is a natural born actor (which isn't extremely likely), or she was telling the truth."
    show Azu P26 at center
    AZ"  Why not ask her yourself?"
    A"  Been there, done that, bought the T-shirt that said “I regret my foolish decision very much”.."
    show Azu P45 at center
    AZ"  Then go ask the bookstore."
    "Azzurra says so as if she doesn't care one bit. I shake my head."
    A"  Well... maybe that's for the best."

    "Except no."
    "If Mr. Ascenderos found the book missing, well, I don't think I'll escape with all limbs in place."
    "Whether it was Azzurra who took it or not, it is poor old me who will get all the flak"
    "If this is a trap, then I'm snared."
    "You sure you want it to happen, Azzurra?"

    show Azu P50_1 at center
    AZ"  Going somewhere?"
    A"  Go see get the bookstore owner…"

    "Then I leave Azzurra's home and back to my self-styled pig style. There's a book to finish and a sleep to get to."
    "Consider it a mystery of the world waiting to be solved."
    "The best way around it, I think, is to wait for one sunny day, dress myself up like a gentleman, then ask Elena herself."
    "That's the only way I can get a satisfactory answer."
    "“You win this time, Azu.”"
    "My murmurs does sound incredibly mean-spirited."
