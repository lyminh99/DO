    A" Azzurra, wait!"
    " My loud voice seems to work: Azzurra stops, but still doesn't turn around."
    A" Allow me one question, alright?"
    A" Do you really believe they can help you do that?"

    " Now she turns around... and looks at me like I'm one of those weird-and-loathsome creature."

    Az" Do elaborate?"

    " I muster all the courage in my being, and look her back. "
    "Her stare is truly terrifying, drilling into me as if piercing me from front to back."

    A" To elaborate – these people, the Schallendorf party aren't having your best interest in mind!"

    " I produce that lot of document I've took all the time to find. I pick out that last page specifically, and present it to Azzurra."

    A" See for yourself!"

    " I pointed to what they wrote: Azzurra as a “test subject”."
    "At first, Azzurra just glances at the thing, as if resigned to the fact that I have nothing worth hearing any more. "
    "Even as she reads that scary line I point to, her face doesn't change at all. “So what?” seems to be her unspoken answer."
    "Then her eyes scan the lines right above that conclusion. Those lines that I read through and understood absolutely nothing."
    "And then her face loses color."
    "I don't know what is happening in Azzurra's head, but I can guess she's quite shocked. "
    "She trembles, and for a second it looks like she would just keel over and faint."
    "I was just prepared to give her a hand so she wouldn't fall flat on the ground."
    "But that hypothetical fall never happens."
    "Azzurra was far quicker to regain herself than I've thought of her. She closes her eyes, and passes me the paper. "
    "Did she know I would need it later?"

    Az" So that's how it is? I see."
    A" You see? They're up for no good!"

    " But then Azzurra opens her eyes, stares at me... and laughs."

    Az" ... They're going down the wrong direction."
    A" Ehhhhh?"
    A" You mean..."

    Az" Let me tell you something, Anatolio."

    Az" I've slept so much since I first came here. Slept rather than read. So like the fake me, and unlike the real me."
    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" I dreamed, Anatolio. Weird dreams. Meaningless dreams, and has no scientific basis whatsoever. I could take days to recount... but every single one of them goes against everything in Gramps' books."

    Az" Perhaps I was hallucinating then, Anatolio. But what I saw... makes sense. So much sense, it hurts."
    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" But what I gathered from those dreams is that... the answer we want is nothing this complicated. It's much, much simpler."
    Az" Perhaps even quantum physics – science of the highest order, isn't going to explain what I need to know. What I must know. Not with this sort of research, anyway."

    " Then she stretches her palm towards me. Her smile has turned unfathomable. As unfathomable as what she's been saying so far."

    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" So... Anatolio, let's be off."

    " Is it really that simple? Am I dreaming or what?"

    A" I-I..."

    Az" Well, rest assured. I'm a bookworm, not a fool. I understand when a plan might work, and when it certainly would not."

    Az"  I'm in no mood to just give up myself for a cause that's meant to fail from day one. That's just stupid."

    " Then Azzurra tilts her head and winks. And I? I know what to do."

    A" Then let's hurry. It will be terribly problematic if these people return. We aren't likely to stay for tea then, no?"

    " Azzurra nods, and smiles. “Right,” she says."
    "Then the both of us run towards to backdoor that hasn't been closed..."
