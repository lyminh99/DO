    "At first, I thought finding Azzurra first is a matter of course."
    "But then on second thoughts... if Azzurra is truly in this house, she's not going anywhere. "
    "Me? I need information, as much as I can lay my hands on. I need to know what has transpired here."
    "So I begin traipsing all over the place, looking for a safe as Mr. Attenborough described."
    "Sounds simple, right? Well, tough luck."
    "Living room: Nothing here."
    "Bedrooms: Nothing out of the ordinary."
    "Corridor: More's the pity."
    "Lavatory: Well, what did I expect?"
    "After a while, I stop, and lean myself against the wall. That's a safe, people, not a pin you can throw into any corner!"
    "I return to the living room, and shake my head. Looks like I must try something else, or..."
    "… what's that I see on the wall? A circular... thing that glints in the light? A soft “ah” escapes my lips. Could it be..."
    "Yes, that's where it is!"
    "I kneel down before the turning knob – because that's what it is. So many letters and numbers are etched along the edges – a bit too many even for a safe."
    "Seems like an insurmountable challenge for a would-be thief. Unless someone has tipped that thief off on the passcode beforehands..."
    "I bite my lips and stare at the letters. Then I swallow hard, my shaky hands reaching out for the knob."

    A"  N1B... 31-1... -1NG... -3N1... -13D."

    "I heard a dull click from just above. A portion of the wall splits open, revealing a sizable storage orifice."
    "There's just a small collection of paper there. No objects, no valuables, nothing of note. Anatolio the thief sighs disappointedly. "
    "Anatolio the paladin knocks him upside the head."

    A" You're here to rescue Azzurra and find the truth, not to pocket stuff! Clear?"

    "I grab the pile of paperwork."
    "Most of the stuff seems to be correspondence between Schallendorf's party and the rest of Aurora. "
    "Signed in alias rather than actual name. Not surprising, but that also means I don't know where to or where from."
    "Nothing too interesting."
    "Some are about experiments – of physical, biological or chemical nature."
    "Some other involved prototyping machines and parts, and where the material should come from."
    "Some other others were notes on the Church's activities, and what the Organization should do about that. "
    "Nothing I don't actually know, to be honest: because my mind and these papers are both full of the Sun Festival."
    "The only letter of interest spoke of an “agreement” with the Church."
    "It is something you have to see to believe, even though Mr. Attenborough had given me some tips."
    "I stuff all I think might be useful later into my backpack, and draw a stiff breath."
    "Time to look for Azzurra."
    "I stand up, close the safe behind me as I found it, and turn around..."
    "… to the sound of shuffling slippers."

    C0" Anatolio. I know you'll come."
    
    "I stop dead in my track. Could it be... Azzurra!"
    "I quickly press my ear against the wall."
    
    A"Azzurra! I-is that you?"
    Az"Silly Ana, who else can it be but me?"
    
    "Before I know it, I am back there, in the corridor."
