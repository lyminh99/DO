    " Suddenly Azzurra about-faces. She walks, and then runs, towards the door."
    "Next thing I heard, the door slams closed with a deafening thud. Panic overtakes me."

    A" Azzurra! Wait!"

    " I don't remember if I got to say goodbye to the priest – or say anything else for that matter."
    "I only know to run after her."

    "It is pouring."
    "The best of the season, they like to say."
    "I normally don't even get a foot out of the door in such weather."
    "But here I am, in the lake. Drenched and chilled to the bone, by the rain and the wind and an overwhelming fear."
    "What deja vu. I'm reliving that night, when they caught Azzurra."
    "Except that she is right there, in front of me. Looking at me."
    "She looks so scarily calm, my Azzurra."
    "So this is the second time Fate has seen it fit to chase her off. In which case, I shall do what I can, so it won't happen a third time."

    A" Will you run away again, Azzurra?"

    " “Again”- I can hardly think of any word so more loaded with tiredness. I don't want to say it again. But here I am, for the third time, saying that much."
    "I swallow hard. If Azzurra has anything to say, I will answer to it."
    "But it's not the first time I had to do the swallowing part."
    "Because Azzurra is turning towards me. Her voice becomes so cold and sharp, more so than the sound of water against rock."

    Az" No. I'm not. Not any more."
    A"  ..."

    " Wait, am I hearing myself right? Or did the rainwater clog my ears just now, or was it the thunder? "
    "Didn't she say she's not running away?"

    A" Then why did you run then? You're looking for a place to cry alone, right? "
    A"No, that's fine, you can come to me. Cry on my shoulder if you want. No need to stand in the rain alone, you know?"

    " I've promised to protect her."
    "My worry for her is all too evident: my heart is beating hard. It is not making a mistake, I'm sure."

    Az" Just that... I was just a bit—"
    A" A bit?"

    " She stays silent for a brief moment. A long breath escapes her mouth: perhaps that's what she wanted to say, but strangled and no word came out."
    "Then she draws in another breath, and looks at me."

    " What else can I do but follow her into the depth of the forest?"
    "Just as my tired eyes thought they'd lost her silhouette behind the rain and the foliage and the shadow, I see Azzurra again, standing in a clearing."
    "Suddenly all else melts away, the night and the leaves and the rain. "
    "There is only a great old tree, majestic yet alone like a crownless king, shunned by his own subjects."
    "I... have been here before. Elena was there, in this clearing, that night I saw her."
    "So Azzurra knows of this place, too?"

    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" Remember the place, Anatolio?"

    " Her question sounds strangely cold and soulless."

    A" ……………"

    " Silence is my choice. "
    "Not because I'd rather not lie as a matter of principles, nor even by the perceived troubles I would have if I admit to have been here with Elena."
    "No, that's simply because I don't think this is a time to say anything."

    "When Azzurra showed me her handiwork, I couldn't help but laugh out loud."
    "A giggle would have done, but I exploded. There's something about tiny Azzurra with her cheeks puffing that does that to you."
    "Azzurra was terribly mad after that, with a frown so unlike her."
    "What was I thinking then?"
    "Right. The picture."
    "We were much drawing the same thing, yet my tree and Azzurra's tree were worlds apart. "
    "Not entirely like falling from the fabled Asgard to Niflheim, but there's something about how she shaped every cloud, "
    "every branch and every leaf that simply makes people... think."
    "Now that I think about it, I can't really judge her drawing as is. In a sense, that art of hers fitted her style: innocent and childlike. "

    " An artist, huh."
    "Under the overarching look of a philosopher and a rationalist, there actually isn't all that much different between an artist and a scientist. "
    "They both explore the physical world around them through differing approaches."
    "Yet, at that time, in my rather shallow view of an egotist of a child? They'd be like two parallel vectors running in two opposite directions."

    "Those eyes frighten me, but not to the same extent as her words."
    "No, she's not wrong. And that's what makes it more frightening."
    "Existing in a world filled with doubt and hate, should you give up? Should you run away? Should you hide? Would you?"
    "It doesn't seem so bad, does it? Hide. Survive. Build a wall, keeping out everyone who might seem halfway threatening. All to build a עדן  world of your own. What's so wrong with that?"
    "Accept that solitude, and give up everything outside it. It... sounds like a good way out for those who cannot change things for the better."

    " And yet... something doesn't seem right."

    "Over the last twenty-four hours I've come to accept the fact that my dear former student has learnt something I am barely an apprentice in: hiding her emotions. "
    "That means... no, I have to dig deeper. Is there anything that doesn't add up? What, and where?"
    "And when, too? What have you noticed?"

    A" Humans are born into an endless struggle. Nothing comes easy, think about it! It's not just your life, but mine, too! I exist because of Mom's struggle. "
    A" Our everyday life? Food on the table, roof over our head? Same!"
    A" Aurora, too, have their own fight – for what they believe right!"

    A" There was a time I quite... looked down on you."
    A" You weren't quick or witty as a child. It was hard to teach you anything. At times I thought, was it worth it to keep teaching a girl who clearly wasn't learning anything? "
    A" Or would it be better to do what I was told to the letter – to protect you like a feeble girl who needs protection?"
    A" “Feeble”. That was what I thought of you then."
    A" And then what? You grew. You matured. You surpassed the me that I thought invincible. Like what you did today."
    A" And there you have it, the proud Anatolio Pietro, the dethroned king whose crown has ever been an illusion, kneeling before an Azzurra Ines who won it with her own diligence and will."
    A" I've always vowed to protect you, yet I am as human as any, and can be as petty and unworthy as I allow myself to be."
    A" That, Azzurra, is my own struggle. To become better and overcome the petty and unworthy me."
    A" That's why I'm glad – truly so! That I've found an equal. That's when I realized how important you are to me."
    A" That's why, Azzurra, it pains me to see you like this."
    A" I beg you. Don't give up."
    A" As for what you want to see done? A world where there's only the two of us, and nothing else matters? That's rather nice, I have to admit. But!"
    A" But until we gain, no, regain what is ours, that עדן world we want to have would just be a lie."
