    " Her eyes closing, Azzurra sits back down on the chair next to the table at the center of the drama just now."

    A" Azzurra? Are you alright there?"

    Az" Sorry. I... need a break."

    "Azzurra slumps over the table, exhausted. Is it any surprise now?"

    A" Here? With you?"

    F" You don't trust me, do you?"

    " Word. I think it would take months, if not years, before the venerable priest can ever regain my trust."

    A" I'm afraid that's... not something I'd do."
    show Azu Fredo P2 at center
    F" I see."

    F"  Though I wish you would apply common wisdom. To where do you intend to take her?"
    A"   …"

    F" Home?"
    A" Is there anywhere else, Father?"

    F" Your home might not be as safe as you'd think it is."

    " I stare at him, trying to hide my jump."

    A" Y-you mean..."

    F" You're a clever young man. Did you think by chance you found out where Azzurra is? "

    F" Did you think by chance you were able to contact the kind of information whose holders that the clergy would be willing..."

    F" to throw the mercy of the Creator to the four winds to destroy?"

    " My eyes dilate without knowing. So the priest knows of the business I've been having with Aurora? Unlikely!"
    " Actually... likely. All too likely!"

    F" I would be more cautious if I were you."
    A" But... if you ask me to trust you again..."

    F" Think you I would harm Azzurra?"
    A" But Hanes..."

    F" Old Tiziano was closer to me than a brother – than my brother. His foster granddaughter is as good as mine."
    A" But then Hanes is still your nephew, right? How can you protect Azzurra if..."
    show Azu Fredo P3 at center
    F" Because Hanes has chosen a path I wish he wouldn't have."
    A" What about you? You aren't telling me you'll get into trouble with the Church just because of Azzurra, are you?"
    show Azu Fredo P0 at center
    F"   ..."
    A" Well? Hard to answer, right, Father?"

    " That was what I expected."
    "And then Father Fredo bursts out laughing. That was not."

    A"   Thưa Cha?"

    F"   Anatolio Pietro, con đánh giá ta hơi thấp. "

    F" Anatolio Pietro, just like you to underestimate me. I've lived through enough chaos and turmoil, enough to cow the Pope himself. Let's just say I've got more than most under my belt."

    " My feet freeze. True – why didn't I see that coming?"
    "The priest puts a hand on my shoulder."

    F" Trust me. Azzurra will be safe here."

    " I don't know how my thought process is exactly going right now, but this time, this exact moment, in my mind the Father Fredo we know, the pinnacle of light and a beacon of hope, has come back to life."
    "My sanity may well be slipping... but perhaps I can trust him. For now."
    "Or maybe it is that subconscious anxiousness for the safety of myself and my family that is dominating me. I can't tell for sure which is the reasoning that tips the scale."
    "My decision comes, as naturally as a breath."

    A" In that case... I will count on you, Father."

    " My arms fall to my sides. I, too, am as exhausted as I can ever remember."

    A" Father... Don't make me regret my choice today."

    F" On my honor."
