    " I roll my eyes. Now where have I heard that before? And not just once, too!"

    A" Isn't that... Hanes' father?"

    Pa" Hanes' father. A close friend to me. A more devoted soul to Aurora than the rest of this generation put together. "

    Pa" Aaand... brother to that butcher Massimiliano – or Father Fredo as you know him. That's the man."
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" I suppose you know what happened to him."

    " Not sure if I can make a judgement, but it's more than certain Father Fredo has something to do with it. If not... solely him."

    Pa" If only we were cleverer then. Or more decisive. Or just plain braver."
    A" I'm... sorry. I don't know what to say-"

    " Paul sighs, and looks me in the eyes again."

    Pa" Old tale. That doesn't concern you much. "

    Pa" All I need you to keep in mind is this secret has been made and kept only with blood."

    Pa" Your responsibility, and that of us all, is to protect this place at all cost for as long as you remain in the City."

    Pa" I suggest not making a habit of coming here unless necessary. You don't want to draw attention to yourself, more than you've already."

    " The shudder grows stronger. Have I ever mentioned I do not envy those characters from mystery novels?"
    "Another heavy hand falls on my shoulder before I can well recover."

    Pa"Now, there, rest easy. We're no longer in those dark days twenty years ago. As long as you aren't too reckless, you'll do just fine."
    A" I sure hope..."
    A" Oh? These books... they look older than those on the shelf!"

    " Mr. Attenborough gives the pile a glance. Then he nods."

    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" As old as you can expect of Silvio's old belongings. Or whatever is left of it after the smoke settled."

    " He lifts each and every volume, and shows them to me. "
    "Most of them are old tomes, but from their title I suppose these are history textbooks, literary works and philosophical musings, quite unlike Gramps' old store of natural sciences."
    "Now Mr. Attenborough dusts every single volume, then arrange them neatly back in a pile again."

    Pa" The man was wealthier than most merchants in the City back then. Ironic, that he could only leave this much to his boy."

    Pa" And if you looked at the pitiful state these books were in as we found them? Looks like Hanes didn't even know they exist."

    " He shakes his head. I can't read mind, but I'm pretty sure what he's thinking. Hanes has no use for them now."

    Pa" We had half a mind to put all of this into the archive at some point. "

    Pa" It's all that is left of our unfortunate brother's if nothing else."
    A" M-may I-"
    A" May I bring this home? Or just a few of them?"
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" Oh? And how useful would they be to you?"
    A" Just to learn about things, sir."
    A" I thought if we are looking for a way out of this world – if I want to contribute to that,"
    A"  wouldn't it be better if I get an inkling of what actually is out there?"
    A" Gramps – I mean, Mr. Ines, had a large library himself. Between Azzurra and I, we can keep these volumes safe,"
    A"  until the organization has need of them."
    A" Besides... I do want to keep something close at hand, that reminds us that Hanes Fredo used to exist, imperfect as he was."

    "Mr. Attenborough just stands there in silence for a while. He scratches his stubble, once or twice,"
    "but otherwise does nothing noteworthy. Deep in thought, no doubt."
    "Perhaps, just to make a guess, he'd forgotten Hanes used to be our friend."

    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" Well, well, well. Right. Very right."
    
    "And now he remembers."

    Pa" I think I can do something about that. I'll arrange for them to be moved to your place, one book at a time, some time after your induction."
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa"  Of course, unless there are volumes here you'd rather not have."
    A" May I have a look?"
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" Do feel free."

    " And with that, my work begins in earnest."
    "In the distant future, am I to recall this moment, I can't quite determine how many pages I've flipped, or what exactly were on them."
    "I would only be able to recall one thing:"
    "On the very first page I flip, there are several lines of exceptionally neat handwriting:"
    "“Wer mit Ungeheuern kämpft, mag zusehn, dass er nicht dabei zum Ungeheuer wird."
    "Und wenn du lange in einen Abgrund blickst, blickt der Abgrund auch in dich hinein."
    "He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster."
    "And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee."
    "- Frederick Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil -”"
    "I shake my head."
    "No matter who wrote this, I suppose that Hanes has never read them."
    "Otherwise... well, things might have ended up better for him. And us."
