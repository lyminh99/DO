    " Just as I thought. Hanes has gone nowhere."
    "He waits there still for us, as if waiting for Azzurra and I to return. To give up. To surrender. To admit he won, and we lost."
    "Well, guess what we are not going to do?"

    " I summon all the disdain in me in a single look."

    A" Ceremony calls, Brother Hanes. Wish we could stop and chat, but the Creator waits for no one."

    " Hanes freezes."

    " In a flash, we've found ourselves surrounded by half of the Templars standing guard over the checkpoint."
    "Right. I almost forgot. As a cleric Hanes now outranks the rank-and-file Templars. For the superficial purpose of enforcing Church rules, they might as well be his personal army or something."
    "And he's enjoying that privilege a bit too much."


    H" A-arrest these criminals! For forging official Church paper!"

    " Wait, forging? As in Azzurra's paper is a fake? This is a joke, right? Right?"

    A" What are you playing at, Hanes?!"
    H"I don't play around with business like this. Take them!"
    
    " I can barely breathe. Could this truly be a forgery? Did Father Fredo pull us a fast one?"
    "Come to think of it, that's not impossible. Have I made the mistake of my life, trusting him again?"
    "No, that does make much sense! Azzurra's paper looks identical to mine."
    "Besides... I hope, no, I want to trust Father Fredo!"
    "Besides besides, wouldn't he have way better choices if all he wants is to harm Azzurra?"
    "Of course, there's only so much rational argument can do when you're cut off by so many tall men in bright mail wielding sharp swords."

    A" Tell us how this is fake, because we aren't seeing it!"

    " Hanes doesn't even look at us. He turns towards the column of guard with a broad beam on his face."


    H" L-look here, brothers! Forgery, this thing, and Father Fredo's s-signature's there too!"
    H"  We must i-inform the bishops and cardinals and His H-Holiness too!"

    " One of the Templars walk over, and snatches Azzurra's paper. "
    "His face is furrowed with so many wrinkles and there are ten grey strands on his head to every dark. He looks us up with those old-man eyes, then raise the invitation towards the sun."
    "Then he makes a hand gesture at his team."
    "As they gather around him, I can hear him mumble... certain words, his fave stony and sullen."
    "Eyes scrutinize the invitation, in the light and in the shade."
    "Then the whole contingent collectively stares at us... then back at Hanes."
    "Not a single one makes any sign of preparing to arrest us."

    H" W-what's wrong? A-a-arrest them, I say!"

    " Nobody moves an inch, but for throwing questioning looks at Hanes."
    "The standoff goes on until the old Templar walks forward."
    "He looks half apologetic and half disappointed, too, as he bows ceremoniously."

    LG" All due respect, Brother. I'm afraid we can't do that."

    H"What? W-why not? This is in-in-insubordination!"
    LG" This is a perfectly valid pass, and we are not going to hassle these perfectly valid youth for no reason, Brother."

    " I don't think I have ever seen Hanes so scary: brows standing on ends, teeth audibly grinding. "
    "If nobody were looking, he might as well have leaped in and murdered someone."

    H" Sh-shut it! I say it's fake, fake, fake! Hence it i-is!"
    
    "Would it be good if I rub it in? Heck, why don't I do it?"
    
    A" So? How goes it, Brother Hanes? All in good order, I hope?"

    " Hanes' face twist. His hand balls into a fist, then slap!"
    "The old Templar staggers back, nursing the bruise on his face."

    H" Useless, useless, useless, all of y-you! U-Useless!"

    " In a blink of an eye Azzurra and I are standing in the middle of something resembling a comedy stage. "
    "Everyone converges around us in a large circle. Mumbles echo around us, and I can catch more pointing fingers than I'd care with just the corner of my eyes."
    "“Who's that? What's that?”"
    "“A fight? Someone said a fight here!”"
    "“Who, where, what, why?”"
    "“Oh, isn't that Brother Hanes?”"
    "“Tsk, tsk, so impious and improper, fighting here of all places!”"
    "“A bit too hotheaded for a priest, I've always said!”"
    "“What a mess, Creator forgives!”"
    "No, let me correct. We have no part to do in that act. Everyone has seemingly forgotten good old me and good old blonde Azzurra in her blue getup."
    "Normally I'd take exception to my being ignored. Today? Well, I'd fast and recite the scripture more fervently than a cloistered monk in praise of the Creator for giving me this break!"
    "I click Azzurra's elbow. She nods, and that's all the sign I need."

    A" Oh?  If I'm correct, everyone, we are entitled to enter, are we? Are we?"

    " I wave the tickets of ours before the crowd like a banner."

    A" Look one, look all! We're good citizens, doing everything so lawfully, invitation and medal and all. "
    A" By the Creator's law and mercy, Brother Hanes here should have gladly let us in, rather than cause such a mess!"
    A" This is an offense! An outrage! Let everyone be our judge!"

    " Checkmate, Hanes."
    "Hanes ignore my words, still if the bestial gurgle from his throat is of any indication. But the crowd, well, the crowd doesn't. And perhaps won't, ever."
    "So does the crowd."
    "“That's enough, Brother! Do your job!”"
    "“Right, right, this isn't right!”"
    "“Let them in, will you?”"
    "“Told you lot the idiot shouldn't have been made a priest!”"
    "Hanes' face reddens. His knees wobble. Like he would keel over unconscious any minute now."
    "Credit where credit is due, he has more fortitude than I do. If I were him, seeing everything I've planned for whatever reason collapsing like a house of card... "
    "well, I might have gone mad enough to drown myself in the lake or something."

    H"  …"

    " I was going to say “Wolf's got your tongue?” or something to that effect. "
    "But then the kinder half of me insists that would be too vengeful, too vindictive... too evil. That's not who I am, it argues. I'm better than that, it argues."
    " True. I've got what I want. Let's give him a way out."

    A" Let us in, and we won't press charges. Can we?"

    H" … Go. G-get lost…. To all tar-tar-tarnations..."

    " I make a mocking bow."

    A" Then we shall excuse ourselves, Brother Hanes. May good health, fortune and success be with you in your noble capacity."

    " With Azzurra on my side and the sun over our head, we step towards the altar."
    "The Templars give us no more trouble through the checkpoint."
    "I swear one of them is even giving us an approving smile as we pass through the last arch."
