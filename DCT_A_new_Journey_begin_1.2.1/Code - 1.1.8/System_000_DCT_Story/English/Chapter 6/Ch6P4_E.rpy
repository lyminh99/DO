    " It's a dark, moonless evening. Perfect. All I need is a black cloak and an excuse to my parents (“Going to catch some fresh air, Mom!”), and there I am."
    "I take no pleasure in lying to their face like that, but they certainly aren't ready to learn of my decision. Heck, it might even put them into danger."
    "I try to keep my head clear and leave as much of my fear behind as I make my way to the lake."
    "Thankfully, I've drawn no real attention, and have been thus far accosted by no city guards. That might be problematic..."
    "And just like I expected, my contact has already been waiting. Mr. Attenborough's silhouette in the moonlight is visible from quite a distance..."
    "… maybe that has something to do with the thing he's towing along this time: A small, light carriage, painted black."
    "As he waves at me, I see him produce from his person a small, round, metallic object. He glances at it once, then stows it back to where it belongs."

    Pa" Look what we have here, progress! I've only been waiting for thirty five minutes, twelve seconds and 528 milliseconds."
    A"  Sir."
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" I suppose you've made up your mind."
    A" Yes, sir. I will join."
    show Azu Paul P3 at center
    Pa" Good! Like I said before: We need good men. Like you-"

    " He glances at the carriage as he speaks."

    A" And this is..."
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" You'll follow me, I think? We'll not force you to walk."

    " A wave of panic runs through me. Now wait just a second there! Nobody said anything about leaving right about now! "
    "I haven't even said goodbye to Dad, Mom, Mr. Ascenderos or Elena! And then there's Azzurra, too!"

    A" I'm sorry? We'll be leaving the City? Like... right now?"
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" Not quite, no. We need you where you are. And if you'd obey your superior, you will stay where you are."
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" I'm just taking you to a place not far from where you live. You'll need to come there rather often in the future."

    " I must have looked like a scaredy cat just then: Mr. Attenborough quite sees through me,"

    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" Well? Getting cold feet, are we?"
    A" N-no, sir, but..."

    " He studies me for a moment, then folds his arms."

    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" Hmm. Not quite made up your mind, have you?"
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" Ah well. Can't help it. That happens often."

    " Then he tosses me a tiny flask."

    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" A bit of coffee clears heads like nothing else.."
    A" Coffee, sir?"
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" How can I put it? When you're drunk on alcohol, you'd tell the truth, but lose all senses of rationality."
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa"  On the other hand, being high on coffee makes your mind clearer... more rational... and more cowardly."
    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa" Drink deep, and let me know what your rational self would truly say."
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" This is the last time I can let you choose. No going back, not this time, lad."

    " For a while I stare at the flask, like it holds within it all the truth there is to hear in the world. Then I uncork the thing, and emptied the content into my mouth."
    "My body shivers from the bitterness? Seriously? Call this a drink? I've taken better-tasting medicine!"
    "Let's take it this way: As the drink courses through my system, suddenly everything about me looks clearer. My mind springs to work: better... faster... truer to myself..."
    "Right. One last chance to make a choice. Think carefully, Anatolio! What do you really want, and what can you afford to lose for it?"
    "Eyes open. Eyes close. Eyes open. Eyes close."
    "Very well. Very well then."
    "Let's have it that way."

    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" Well? I'm still waiting right here."
    A" Yes, sir. I've made up my mind.."
