    A" Azzurra, wait!"

    "My loud voice seems to work: Azzurra stops, but still doesn't turn around."

    A" Y-you really don't want to return? To our life like before? You and me, and Elena at times, and Hanes, too, and my parents, and..."

    "Azzurra shakes her head quietly."

    Az" Let me ask you this, Anatolio, How long do we get to live?"
    A"  W-what do you mean?"

    Az" Fifty years? Sixty? Seventy or eighty if you're lucky? Even the things that seem so permanent,"
    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" so eternal like the Church or the City, how long have they been there, and how long will they be around? Hundreds of years? Or several thousands, maybe?"
    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" Well, the universe's been here for billions."
    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" In those billions of years, you'd need to run fast as the light itself to cover its length and breadth."
    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" In those billions of years, millions upon millions of sentient species have come to existence, and then erased as if they'd never been there."

    Az" In those billions of years, the immortals themselves are like children, building sandcastles on an endless beach,"
    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" and then one day all of that, too, would be washed away by that ocean beyond, leaving nothing behind."
    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" Now, let me ask you: What are we, as humans, in front of that infinity? "
    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" Just an atom, at best, part of a grain of sand on that beach, that the naked eyes can't even see."
    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" I can live like an invisible particle like that. Or I can work with them , and find out just a part, just a part of that infinite mystery. "
    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" Would I not be more useful in the latter way than the former?"

    Az" Would you not agree, Anatolio?"

    " I shake my head faster than I – or Azzurra – thought I can."
    " Part of me starts to regret. I shouldn't have introduced her to so many books and theories, "
    " so she would one day use my typical scientist's thinking against me in a most ironic fashion."
    " And I, the master who was overcome by his student, cannot come up with a proper answer. "
    "She has just posed to me the questions that I have asked myself, but never willingly tried to answer."
    "I don't have an argument to have Azzurra come with me. Not without force, no."
    "… But I shall not do that. Then I would be no different from them . "
    "I might be even worse than them, because at least they want Azzurra for a question worth asking and worth answering."
    "I cut my breath short."

    A" You... are right."
    A" But are you sure you want it this way? You will be fine, will you?"

    " Azzurra's newly-gained small smile returns."

    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" Look at you. I'm more than sure. I'm not a child any more, see? I'm even a chaosspawn infinite in malice and unfathomable, according to the mass!"

    Az" You'd better go home, Anatolio. The Sun Festival calls. Your adulthood calls. Time to go home, pay your debt to family and society, and become a respectable person as you are meant to be."
    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" And please forget I have ever existed."

    " There's that melancholic smile on her face again. No, perhaps it is I who was hallucinating. "
    "Azzurra... actually is far from sorrowful. She's found her path, and will do what she can to trudge along, crawl, if need be, along that path."
    "Who am I to intervene?"

    A" Then far- goodbye then, Azzurra."

    " Yes, just a goodbye, like every other day. One day, I will see Azzurra again. I will see Azzurra again."
    "She says no more, only nods, as if thanking me for understanding, and then vanishes behind the door."
    "When I finally realize where I am again, the house is back to its silence. Azzurra has seemingly melted into that haunting silence..."
    "… where she belongs."

    Az"Eh? You don't agree?"
    A" Of course not!"

    " I ball my fist, and draw the longest breath I remember."

    A" Look, this world is vast, and the universe? Way bigger."
    A" And true, we're so tiny and insignificant."
    A" If Anatolio Pietro is to vanish tomorrow, the world would still go on. Life goes on, and the universe remains out there..."
    A" But to my loved ones? Well, that would be quite a blow to everyone. The disappearance of yours truly would mean nothing will be the same to them, ever!"
    A" Is that not why we exist? Why we live? Because to be alive means to have that bond with those around us?"

    " My right fist slam into my open left palm."

    A" I say, we live, because we matter!"
    A" If the universe doesn't bother giving us a terribly important task, if we're that small and insignificant, well, so what? We make our own task!"

    " Azzurra takes one step back. I don't recall she's ever been more surprised."

    A" You, too, Azzurra. You are... important. To me. Is that not something?"

    " Azzurra's face rapidly glows red"

    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" I am... important? To you? Really now?"
    A" Why would I lie about that?"

    " Then I stretch my palm towards her."

    A" Azzurra... it's time to go home. Your home. Your life. No, our life. Where you really belong."

    " Azzurra begins to tremble. Her eyes wet, it does seem she's struggling quite hard with herself."
    "One minute... two... three..."
    "A millennium seems to have gone by while I was waiting."
    "And then I feel a hand grabbing mine. Azzurra's."

    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" If you say so... then yes, Anatolio. Time to go home."

    " At once my lungs deflated in a long sigh. I... made it!"

    A" Then let's hurry. It will be terribly problematic if these people return. We aren't likely to stay for tea then, no?"

    " Azzurra nods, and smiles. “Right,” she says."
    " Then the both of us run towards to backdoor that hasn't been closed..."
