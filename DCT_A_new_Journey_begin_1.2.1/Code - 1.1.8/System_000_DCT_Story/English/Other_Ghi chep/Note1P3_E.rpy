    nvlDC"Reverend Massimiliano Fredo stepped before the altar."
    nvlDC"\n Dressed in black, the priest's dark garment presented a stark contrast to the cross necklace draped over his neck – a present from the populace to the Church more than a centuries ago with due piety in their hearts."
    nvlDC"\n His family, the Fredo clan, had been counted among the respected members of society for several generations now. It was an actual sense of respect that they were paid rather than plain lip service. His becoming a priest – representative of the Creator Himself – in and of itself was the subject of much ovation. He had lost count of the many faces that showed up to congratulate him as a young priest on that day. But then came many other events – both those he held in high esteem and those of which he was ashamed."
    nvlDC"\n Father Fredo wiped the droplets of sweat on his brow with his damp sleeve."
    nvl clear

    nvlDC"\n The ceremony was over. He returned, as was his wont, to the Cathedral filled with empty benches. It was the third time that day that he allowed reminiscence to overtake him."
    nvlDC"\n He sung, ever quietly, a song he had kept in his mind since he was but a child. It was not a beautiful song, no, but it was strange to the ear and therefore far more tantalizing to the old priest than any hymn."
    nvlDC"\n Everything was fine. Except it was not. Life was getting better, no doubt, and perhaps that was why the common man's faith had faltered. The Church grew larger as more and more new priests came to be and more churches and chapels built."
    nvl clear

    nvlDC"\n But then few people attended sermons any more. He wouldn't count it against the people who spent their time in taverns and ale-houses, but just from the look of the books alone, he presumed many would be surprised to see the changes in the sum of tithe the Church collects. In a bad way."
    nvlDC"\n But Father Fredo was not sad. On the contrary, the peaceful, worriless life of the common man made him feel rather relaxed. "
    nvlDC"\n Strange, because among them all he was the one with the most reason to be sad – or at least discontented.., He had, like many before him, invested in the settlements on the outskirt of the great City, where the arid prairies lay. Those he helped were little better than nomads, going from place to place, not remembering even their own flesh and blood, much less a stranger. In short, his charities gave him little in the name of renown, let alone wealth.    "
    nvl clear
    
    nvlDC"\n Then there were accusations leveled at him. Let the Cathedral fall into disrepair, they said. Even the Church had choice words for him – things they had issues with. And then the rumors simply fueled themselves.It took but five years: now the number of churchgoers who attended his sermons were but a quarter of what it used to be. At his plight some shook their head or laughed it off, others shared his concerns for but a short while, and other still said nothing – just left. Now this was the norm of the place: the old priest, in his seventies, spending his long days watching over a cathedral underneath the marks of lonely spiders."
    nvlDC"\n “Footsteps.”"
    nvlDC"\n The quiet atmosphere made the steps of the Creator's man sound louder than it actually was. One after the other, they echoed upon the empty hall like a loyal friend who simply refused to leave.    "
    nvl clear
    
    nvlDC"\n Heavy footsteps they were, lonely and interspersed with moments of silence."
    nvlDC"\n The old priest drew his dew-soaked hair to one side. Some strands fell behind, glued to his forehead by the moisture. Tired as he was from the ceremony, Father Fredo still carried on with his habit: marking each and every spot of dust in the gigantic hall, then wipe them all off, one at a time."
    nvlDC"\n Then again, there wasn't a clear distinction between “clean” and “dusty” in this place. Perhaps it would take but a couple minutes after he'd left, and the dust would return, dancing and cajoling before him on the old, weathered brown oak."
    nvl clear
    
    nvlDC"\n He knew it for a fact, yet said fact dissuaded him none. He went on with his cleaning, back and forth, seemingly caught in an infinite circle of his own making."
    nvlDC"\n If it had been a battle, the result had been a foregone conclusion from the start – and he was doomed to lose."
    nvlDC"\n ““Bravery” or “stubbornness” - what was the difference when one was about to lose anyway?"
    nvl clear
    
    nvlDC"\n What he was doing was infinity, and yet it was naught."
    nvlDC"\n Yet the old priest would gladly give up his life for but a second – a second! That everything would be clean and dustless, at least in this sacred hall. "
    nvlDC"\n Of course, in the grand scheme of things, “clean” and “dirty”, “good” and “evil”, even “winning” and “losing” are but naught. That he knew all too well."
    nvlDC"\n Yes, that was the kind of person the old priest was."
    nvl clear

    " The strange noises by his ear cut short the old priest's song. Bile churned up in his throat, which he swallowed into his guts."
    " His white brows shook ever so slightly," 
    " unnoticeable to all but the most attentive."
    " It wasn't just a simple noise, but instinct itself that was holding the old man's attention. "
    " So Father Fredo kept his eyes closed, his mind's eye imagining what he had just saw – slowly an calmly, as befitting a man as old as he was…"

    " The kids, children of the poor common folks, were – at the end of the day – lovers of excitement."
    " Scant were the days they wouldn't hop their little soiled feet to the riverside, "
    " throwing pebbles and poking fish, before turning their attention to the draft horses in the merchant quarters."
    " They'd even jump into the merchants' crates and boxes and fall asleep there, only to wake up screaming when the wagons started rolling. "
    " Then it would be up to Father Fredo to save them from the imminent punishment for dirtying the merchandise. "
    " Since then, they'd grown fond of this old rundown cathedral, and in turn the old priest welcomed them. Candies changed hands, and laughters filled the halls."

    " The commotion drew closer. Father Fredo began to orientate its direction."
    " Then came the footsteps, mingled with the sound of cold steel and the creaking of wooden wheel axles."
    " The latter was low and warm to the ear rather than crude – yet strangely unfamiliar. Was there something abnormally heavy on the wagon?"
    " Ah, perhaps this old man was imagining, he thought. He let out a quiet chuckle – at himself."
