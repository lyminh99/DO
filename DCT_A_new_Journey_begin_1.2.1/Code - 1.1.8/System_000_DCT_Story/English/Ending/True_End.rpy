    " Just a parting like any other, that was what I thought. What I wanted."
    "But the both of us knew right then, that this was the end. I would never see Azzurra again."
    "Azzurra vanished almost as the last prayer at the Festival was recited. Vanished from the Church, and my life."

    "Without her... it didn't take long for me to forget. And with forgetfulness came mistakes, failings, errors... and irreversible choices."

    "Like children, we play, without heed to consequences. We turn the unknown wheel. We press the buttons on a metaphorical keyboard."
    "Is that not the nature of sins and wrongdoings?"
