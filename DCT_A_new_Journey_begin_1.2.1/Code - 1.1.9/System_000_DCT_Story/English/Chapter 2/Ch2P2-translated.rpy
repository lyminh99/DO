    "Well, no matter how much I opposed to his being with us, it does feel nice being the boss."
    A" Well? What are you trying to say, Hanes?"
    "I prop my chin, making the most serious face within my capability."
    "The most difficult thing of being boss is not sitting on that chair, but carry yourself in such a way that the others respect your authority."
    " That's what I've been trying to live up to."

    A" That's it?"

    H" Yeah. T-that's because you were s-so noisy outside the cath-cathedral. I h-have to bring you g-guys in here."
    "Hanes answers, shaking his head. I really, really should have a satisfactory answer for him, shouldn't I?"
    A" Oh. Yes. Business. Well, from the beginning there was only Azzurra and I, so there doesn't seem to be an opening for you yet. At least, in this river water research project we're doing. But... well, some discussions can't hurt-"
    "Lest you forget, this is a difficult problem Mr. Ines posed back in his days. "
    "It ranks first among all his unanswered questions at the back of his journal."

    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" Something sa-satisfying three con-conditions: Ins-insoluble, doesn't vaporize, and n-not too heavy. Is-isn't that enough?"
    A" Smooth. Now how can we find this most fabled plant?"

    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" Wh-why not? We can search it u-up! I do have a st-store of botanical books... we can h-have a look!"
    "Hardly has he finished the sentence, an excited Hanes produces a pile of old books from one of his mysterious storage compartments. Azzurra's eyes flare up like a candle in the night."
    A" Fine."
    "Given Azzurra's enthusiasm, I have no choice but to sigh and give up resisting. Then, of course, came a search I'm sure will be fruitless."
    "On my part, while I'm no expert, with what Mr. Ines taught me about the world's flora, I am willing to bet the possibility that such a plant exists is... close to nil. Even if it does exist, shouldn't Mr. Ines have thought about it in the first place?"
    "But then-"
    H" G-got it!"

    "Hanes' exclamation knocks my train of thoughts off its track."

    H" Eichhornia. That's it. A-a rare species of aq-aquatic plant. It is extr-extremely resilient, too. Isn't that our b-best bet?"

    "I skim over the book Hanes gave me."
    "Truly, this is a plant I have never heard of. As luck would have it: It fulfills all the preconditions Hanes set out!"
    "Now, if we can make a sample sink to the bottom of the lake, if it appears once again upstream, we'll have an indisputable proof for Mr. Ines' “fish tank” model. Such a discovery will shake the world, I tell you!"
    "But then, of course, the problem is—"

    "Hanes' smile looks like a frown. Just like Elena's poor puppy Nessy whenever her mistress ignores her."
    A" In short, worthless and pointless endeavors. All of them."

    Az" Anatolio. Don't talk like that about my grandpa!"
    A" Right, right, I'm sorry! It's all my fault, alright?"
    "Seeing Azzurra like so, I have no choice but to let her have the cake this time. To be honest, I do want to provoke her a little fjust to break the ice. But then, knowing her... that might be much less wise than I thought it is."

    H" If we d-don't have projects of our o-own, why not have oth-others bring projects for us?"

    A" Which is to say?"
    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" Which is to say... we'll open an inv-investigative service. These days the Ch-church is busy, too, so if we do lend th-them a hand... well I don't think Father Fredo will m-mind!"

    "Accordingly, we would become something like a private eye: helping the Church and the city authorities with those little things that slip under the crack. Petty thievery, for instance."
    "Not exactly what I'd like to do. Not to mention..."
    A" That sounds good... on paper. Who will trust us?"

    H" H-hey! I just l-look like this, but I h-happen to be one of those res-respectable sort!"
    A" That makes sense. Nobody would waste time bearing suspicions against a simpleton like you."

    H" S-say what?"
    A" Nothing. What I mean is, having Hanes working with the Church is sooo~ convenient."

    H" Ah, l-let it slide. Sh-shall we do it?"
    A" No losses to me. A good beginning as any, methinks."

    "And so, our investigative team's second incarnation comes to be."
    "Will we or will we not strike the motherlode this time?"

    "It should be early winter now. But then the cold... doesn't seem to come."
    "No matter how much warmth the Gods stuff into the sun, it doesn't come halfway close to the fire in my heart."

    A" So... this is all that is to it?"
    "After leaving all the typical petty thefts to Hanes, this is all that I have left for me."
    "Three questions on a piece of paper, written by Hanes' hands. His handwriting is barely legible, to put it lightly."

    H" Oh, oh, oh, my friends! O-of course not!"   
    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" Here's the st-story: There are three old friends who h-haven't met for years. The first's a m-musician, the second a t-teacher, the third an engi-engineer or something from a p-particular manufac-manufactury."
    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" They met in a tavern or something. P-played poker, won a bunch, then crawled to the b-bar for some hard drink. Th-then – drink and the Faceless' d-done for the rest – they begin to ar-argue. Challenge one-one another."


    "Hanes' voice echoes all over the holy ground of the cathedral. Father Fredo, as per usual, is off somewhere on Church duty."
    " I wouldn't wish that weight upon anyone: he was leading a ceremony at the cathedral just earlier, and already he's off."


    A" Challenge, with these questions?"
    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" Y-yep. The rule was, each would br-bring forward a question. The rest w-would come up with an an-answer."
    H" One answer p-per person. W-whoever gets the right answer gets one t-third of the poker winnings. If not, the as-asker gets the share."
    A" That is too simple isn't it? They have three different professions... different expertise."
    A" Ask something within their respective specialty, and the remaining two will be stumped."
    "That won't make the game better or fairer, but at least that guarantees a win and therefore a share of the winning."

    H" Eh... well, if only it were th-that simple."
    "Hanes dusts his sleeve. It doesn't feel particularly right, being told off by a simpleton like him like that. Then he declares, hands on the hip."

    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" The rule w-was, the question has to be based on things all th-three players have already known. "
    H" In o-other words, they all have the key within them. Except they d-don't know where it m-might be."
    "A musician. A teacher. An engineer. Well, color me surprised."
    " I might buy it that a teacher and an engineer might have met before. But an artist? Where's the logical connection?"
    "If they do share something in common, knowledge-wise... must be something incredibly basic and axiomatic."
    "Wait a sec. If it were a simple question... Hanes wouldn't have brought them before me. While I haven't read the questions, I'm sure of it."
    "“Well, here we go.”"

    A" I see. So it's up to personal smarts and acumen."
    "In other words, an ego-stroking game."
    "Well I'm in need of stroking my own ego, too. Let's give it a go."
    A" Let's shoot this party down!"
    "I feel an adrenaline rush all over my body. My cheeks are heating up. Ready for the game, Anatolio? Sure is."

    H" First c-came the engineer's q-question: On the wall of the t-tavern a wh-wheel was hung. "
    H" Assuming it had been sus-suspended on a rope: one connected to the ce-ceiling, the other to the cen-center of its mass without any support."
    H" H-how do you keep the w-wheel vertical?"
    "Hanes reads out the question. Trying to take it slow to cut down the stuttering."

    H" So, so, so? Tough o-one, isn't it?//Hanes cười nham hiểm// D-don't ask me for the answer!"

    H" W-won't it fall horizontal again in the end?"
    "Doesn't look like he bought it. However, I'm as sure of my answer as the sun rising in the East each dawn. You don't go denying the sun rising."

    A" Try for yourself then?"
    "I toss him a toy wheel and a fishing string."
    " That's me and my lack of neatness: I can produce junks like this without even knowing where I got them from, just lying around there."
    "The rest of the work is up to Hanes, who, at least, does as he is instructed."
