    nvlDC" The Cathedral of St. Vito, named after one of the many aliases of St. Vitus the Lord of the Skies, was built on the Western side of the Great Continent, looking over Lake Meyr itself. It was a good place once upon a time, back when the Y-shaped bridge connecting the three sectors of the city over the rivers were still visible from its foyer. Said bridge, back then, was so nicknamed “Bridge of the Crooked Geezer” by the kids, perhaps because of its peculiar arc over the river just like, well, an old and bent man trying to walk.. 
    "
    nvlDC"\n That, my friends, is history now. The “Crooked geezer” has been put to rest, dismantled five months ago, leaving but a small river port in his place. It is only the name, it seems, that is immortal..
    "
    nvlDC"\n On the left side of the Cathedral, over the Lower Astraea, was the Merchant's Guild quarters, crowded and busy. Right there, the Guild has taken the effort to build a far larger and prettier bridge. Smooth granite made up its bulk, put in place after five years, six days and three hours' worth of work.

    nvlDC" That is the way things are: one day the Cathedral was alone on its sacred oasis, and the next – as the moneyed folks from the Seat of the Caravans rode across the sacred river – it became so small and seemingly insignificant.  
    "
    nvlDC"\n The Cathedral's composition, an ash-grey shade painted upon the four walls draping around massive stained glass windows taller than six men that couldn't be seen through from outside, only made the building look quieter and more detached. It wasn't even for want of piety of the rich that this state came to be. Many other churches and cathedrals around the city, funded by the Guild, has assumed greater statures for a long time now. 
    "
    nvlDC"\n Here, if I am to put my money on the words on the streets, the only change to have taken place all along was the old fence, demolished in a certain noodle incident exactly eight years ago yesterday morning.

    nvlDC"\n Now only the lonely weathered walls remain. That, and the masonry on the roof obviously wants to stay, too. Frankly spoken, the Cathedral is none too colorful, nor decorated with reliefs of the gods in gold and silver, nor held up by pillars etched with the perfect images of the gods and the saints clad in flawless silk. But it is enough to bother them rich kids and their infinite capacity for curiosity. “Who is the stubborn old man trapped in there?” they'd ask.”
    "
    nvlDC"\n And so no matter how much the surrounding changes, within those walls rests still the air of many decades before.
