    Az" I know what you want to say, Anatolio. The answer is no."
    A" Oh no, Azzurra. I know what you want to say, Azzurra, and the answer is also no."
    A" I was going to say, you underestimate me."

    " Azzurra's eyes widen."

    Az" Eh? What are you getting at?"
    A" I know this much, Azzurra. You've always locked yourself within a wall of your own making."
    A"  A mask of silliness and carefreeness. Lots of books and stories. And so many worries about absolutely everything."
    A" Now you're giving yourself a shell of burdens you think nobody gets."
    A" What the world is, what its nature entail... you think it's your own concern and nobody else's?"
    A"  That if an Azzurra appeared without any sense whatsoever in this world, through arcane science or divine calling or whatnot, it's up to her to find out why?"

    Az" … No... That is... I'm not mistaken."
    A" Well, you are. That question is mine as it is yours!"

    " Azzurra's eyes widen even more."

    Az" Your question?"
    A" Why not? Because that is your question to ask!"
    A" Everything that makes Azzurra think. Everything that Azzurra asks. Everything that Azzurra forces herself to think. "
    A"Consider them all, and more, to be undertakings Anatolio has to carry out!"
    A" Because Azzurra is important to Anatolio. The first reason, the last reason and the only!"

    " Azzurra shakes her pigtail."

    A"  Well, why do you think I know you were there, in that house, about to be made... no, make yourself into a test subject?"

    A" Exactly, Azzurra."

    " I toss Father Fredo a glance with “Arrest me if you wish” on it, and looks her in the eyes."

    A" I now have this tie with Aurora. Their mission and yours, whatever they might be, are mine.."
    A" Whether I like it or not, I'm in the in. You can't help it."

    " Azzurra seems to be mumbling something. An objection, is what it looks like."
    "But then she stops."
    "She only shakes her head again and look at me, in disappointment and relief alike. Azzurra can be as mysterious as Elena once she so chooses."

    A" Say that again?"

    Az" You're the most stubborn, bullish, foolhardy fellow I've ever known!"
    A"Won't be Anatolio without that. Would I?"

    Az"What if I play your own game and not follow you? What if I do, and find myself stopped at the ceremony because no medal? What will you do?"
    A" If there's a will, there's a way. What matters is that we'll be together. I'll protect you – no, we'll cover each other's back!"
    A" Because you matter."

    " Azzurra doesn't answer. Or rather, I've just tossed a spanner in her thought process. Her eyes glue to the ground, feet rubbing against the floor, hands fidgeting uncontrollably."

    A" If... if you let me protect you, everything will be fine. Everything!"

    " I raise my hand to the sky, then kneel down before the pulpit."

    A" I… I can swear in the name of-"

    A" Well, Father, this is important to me!"

    Az" If you're to go with a figure rejected by society, what am I to say to your parents?"
    A"  …"

    " True. I may not want to admit it, but she is... right. I am an only child, useless as I may be. "
    "If I am to abandon everything, citizenship included, to wherever... what will become of my parents?"

    "Furious. Incredibly, incredibly furious."

    A" T-then why didn't you tell us before?"
