    " Controlled breathing is hard, with a decision such as this. I must be huffing and puffing through my clenched teeth."
    "Let's do it, Anatolio. Make a decision, and stand by it!"

    A" I... won't see Mr. Attenborough again."
    A" What he can... what they can promise, that's not what I want. Not the ideal I'd like to swear by."
    A" All being told, I'm just an ordinary fellow, in an ordinary fellow, whose adventures and arrogance have led to nothing good."
    A" I'll be content with just being plain old Anatolio Pietro, warts and all. Not so pretty, not so perfect, not even extraordinary..."
    A"But that's what I am. The life they promise, that's not for me."

    " Azzurra's clasped hands quiver. Am I just imagining thing, or is she – or at least part of her – begging me to reconsider?"
    "… that's just not going to happen."
    "Because I know what is important to me."

    Az" I see."

    " Her voice is disappointment given sound."

    Az" You... will not change your mind?"

    " If I say I don't feel a smidgen of guilt, then I'd be the biggest liar out there."
    "Again doubt returns. Should I have chosen otherwise?"

    A" … Or... if you aren't up for it..."

    " She shakes her head."

    Az" That's quite... alright."

    Az" I said I will stand by you no matter what, didn't I? It's just... a little..."

    " Azzurra smiles bitterly: having accepted her destiny no matter how reluctantly."

    A"  ..."

    " No, I can't turn back again. I've made a decision, and..."

    A" That's probably for the best."

    " The atmosphere feels like it had been engulfed in so much invisible gel as to drown us in silence."
    "But that doesn't have to be the way to go, does it? Of course not!"

    A" But!"

    " Azzurra raises her brows quizzically. Not unexpected – I must be looking like a fool, voice raised and hands slamming on the table and all."

    A" If that's not meant to be... How about I make a new plan?"
    show Azu P50_1 at center
    Az" A new plan?"
    A" Exactly! For me, for you... for us!"
    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" You mean..."
    A" The future."

    " For a brief moment I thought I'd failed: Azzurra stares at the ground, not looking up at all. Is my suggestion that outlandish?"

    show Azu P10 at center
    Az" The future, huh…"

    "But then she looks up."
    "And underneath that blonde curtain, I can see her smile – Azzurra's smile, bright and cheerful, as I'd like her. "
    "As our eyes meet, what I see is a new dawn. The future. And happiness. All of them make a home in my heart at the same time."

    show Azu P11 at center
    Az" I... like the sound of that."

    scene cg_7 with dissolve
    " There is this very light sweetness on her lips. Light, yet incredibly warm, like aged wine or fine tea, without the bitterness of either."
    "Just for this moment, all troubles and anxiousness has left me. There is just us who remain, and that is all that matters."
    "Guess this is goodbye, Aurora. You've been good to me... but I've got other plans now."
    "Azzurra, if I can make you a promise? We'll make ourselves a life as sweet as today's kiss."
    "Let's do it, shall we?"
