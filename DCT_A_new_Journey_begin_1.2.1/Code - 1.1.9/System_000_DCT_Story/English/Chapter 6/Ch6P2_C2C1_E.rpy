    H" Choice's yours."

    " Hanes' voice grasps me like a hungry apparition. Color drains from the world around me."
    "… I..."
    "… I do as he says. I think. I close my eye, and I think."
    "… and I let go."

    " Yes, True. Azzurra is important to me."
    "But there are more important things out there. My parents for one. Or my future."
    "Perhaps I've become a coward. To be more exact, the coward that has always dwelt in the deepest part of me is rearing his ugly head."
