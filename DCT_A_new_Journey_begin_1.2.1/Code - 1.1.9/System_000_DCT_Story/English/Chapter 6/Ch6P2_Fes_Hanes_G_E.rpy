    " Hanes stands there still in front of the checkpoint, probably doing his job. His eyes widens at the sight of us."

    H" Oh? A-Anatolio? A-And... A-A-Azzurra too?"
    A" In the flesh, Hanes!"

    " I wave Azzurra's ticket before his eyes like a banner."

    A" Look what we just got ourselves!"

    Az" Praise be to the Creator, I've got mine."

    " Hanes stands there, as if frozen for a while. Poor fellow! "
    "I bet he'd hoped to be able to give Azzurra a ticket himself, and never expected good old me to be able to deliver it."

    " I give both our tickets to Hanes."

    A" That's it, right? Everything done? Can we go through now?"

    " … Wait, what?"
    " In a flash, we've found ourselves surrounded by half of the Templars standing guard over the checkpoint."

    H" A-arrest these criminals! For forging official Church paper!"

    " Forging? This is a joke, right? Right?"

    A" What are you playing at, Hanes?!"

    H" I don't play around with business like this. Take them!"

    " I can barely breathe. Could this truly be a forgery? Did Father Fredo pull us a fast one?"
    "No, that's impossible. Azzurra's paper looks identical to mine."
    "Besides... I hope, no, I want to trust Father Fredo!"
    "Of course, there's only so much trust can do when you're cut off by so many tall men in bright mail wielding sharp swords."
    "But more importantly... what is wrong with Hanes?"

    A" Are you mad, Hanes?"

    " He doesn't even look at us."

    H" L-look here, brothers! Forgery, this thing, and Father Fredo's s-signature's there too! "
    H" We must i-inform the bishops and cardinals and His H-Holiness too!"

    " One of the Templars walk over, and snatches Azzurra's paper. "
    "His face is furrowed with so many wrinkles and there are ten grey strands on his head to every dark. He looks us up with those old-man eyes, then raise the invitation towards the sun."
    "Then he makes a hand gesture at his team."
    "As they gather around him, I can hear him mumble... certain words, his fave stony and sullen."
    "Eyes scrutinize the invitation, in the light and in the shade."
    "Then the whole contingent collectively stares at us... then back at Hanes."
    "Not a single one makes any sign of preparing to arrest us."

    H" W-what's wrong? A-a-arrest them, I say!"

    " Nobody moves an inch, but for throwing questioning looks at Hanes."
    "The standoff goes on until the old Templar walks forward."
    "He looks half apologetic and half disappointed, too, as he bows ceremoniously."

    LG" All due respect, Brother. I'm afraid we can't do that."
    H" What? W-why not? This is in-in-insubordination!"
    LG" This is a perfectly valid pass, and we are not going to hassle these perfectly valid youth for no reason, Brother."
    
    "I don't think I have ever seen Hanes so scary: brows standing on ends, teeth audibly grinding. If nobody were looking, he might as well have leaped in and murdered someone."
    H" Sh-shut it! I say it's fake, fake, fake! Hence it i-is!"
    LG" That's not how it work, Brother Hanes. To our eyes this is as valid as any we've checked this morning."
    
    " He points to the seal on the invitation. A bright, shiny, twinkling seal, that looks so much like fantasy to my eyes yet so real."

    LG"This is my fourth time doing my duty to the Creator, Church and City in the ceremony, Brother. "
    LG" I guarantee with my life, this seal is not fake, forged, imitated, altered or otherwise tampered with in any way, shape or form."

    " His finger stops on the edge of the paper."

    LG" If this were a fake document..."

    H" Shut up! Shut up! Sh-shut up!"
    A" Hanes, I... well, I don't know what you're thinking. I don't know how we've offended you or something, but we are friends, right? Can't we..."

    " Hanes' face twist. His hand balls into a fist, then slap!"
    "The old Templar staggers back, nursing the bruise on his face."

    H" Useless, useless, useless, all of y-you! U-Useless!"

    " In a blink of an eye Azzurra and I are standing in the middle of something resembling a comedy stage. "
    "Everyone converges around us in a large circle. Mumbles echo around us, and I can catch more pointing fingers than I'd care with just the corner of my eyes."
    "“Who's that? What's that?”"
    "“A fight? Someone said a fight here!”"
    "“Who, where, what, why?”"
    "“Oh, isn't that Brother Hanes?”"
    "“Tsk, tsk, so impious and improper, fighting here of all places!”"
    "“A bit too hotheaded for a priest, I've always said!”"
    "“What a mess, Creator forgives!”"
    "No, let me correct. We have no part to do in that act. Everyone has seemingly forgotten good old me and good old blonde Azzurra in her blue getup."
    "I don't care. What I care is what has happened to Hanes. Who is this thing taking his shape, and what has he done to my old friend?"

    A" Hanes! Hanes! You hear me? Leave it! Leave it! We'll talk later, alright? After this is over; but now we need to pass!"

    " Hanes ignore my words, if the bestial gurgle from his throat is of any indication."
    "So does the crowd."
    "“That's enough, Brother! Do your job!”"
    "“Right, right, this isn't right!”"
    "“Let them in, will you?”"
    "“Told you lot the idiot shouldn't have been made a priest!”"
    "Hanes' face reddens."

    Az" T-that's right, Hanes! This isn't like you!"

    H"  …"

    " His knees wobble. Like he would keel over unconscious any minute now."
    "I lift a hand towards him. We've been friends, I should help him, right? Right?"
    "All I get is a loud slap in the back of my hand."
    "It hurts beyond the biting red mark on my skin."

    A" Fine. Fine, fine. Alright, then just let us in. Just let us in. Please?"

    H" … Go. G-get lost…. To all tar-tar-tarnations..."
    A" Then... well, I'll see you later. Promise!"

    " The Templars give us no more trouble through the checkpoint."
    "Yet the question hangs heavily with my every step. What has happened to Hanes? What's with all this? Is he still our friend?"
    "… Guess I'm not getting an answer now, am I?"
