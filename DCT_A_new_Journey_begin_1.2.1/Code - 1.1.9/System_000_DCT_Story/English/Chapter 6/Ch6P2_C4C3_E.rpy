    A" What a pity, Hanes. What a pity."
    A" Do I look like I'll work with a coward like you?"

    " Hanes glowers at me. For once, his stammering seems to come back."

    H" A-are you kidding, Anatolio?"

    H" You know what will h-happen to Azzurra if you don't do as I say, do you?"

    H" Oh, my friend, not being accepted as human, tha-that's not even the half of it!"

    H"  We both know... we both know what Aurora would do to Azzurra if they lay their hands on such a precious spec-specimen, do we?"
    
    "He may be right. But then, that is..."
    
    A" â€¦ None of your concern, is it?"

    H" Oh! Where's that army coming from, that you'll protect her with? Not from the Church, surely?"

    H"  Though the Templar might have liked another war, I must admit!"

    H" What can I say? You've ever been arrogant, Anatolio. Think yourself great. But you're not! Just a foolish boy, used by all around him... Aurora included!"
    
    "I give him the most carefree shrug I've ever given."
    
    A" Like I said. Nothing that concerns you."

    " Hanes trembles."

    H" You... you'll regret this. Regret I say! REGRET!"

    " Should I feel worried or triumphant? The latter, most decidedly. "
    "I might have been a fool, a coward and an incompetent wretch, but this is the one time... I am Anatolio the Bold."

    A" You done?"

    H"Y-you-"

    " Smirk. Wave hand. Look annoyingly victorious. Aaand... done."

    A" Good. Now go play somewhere I don't have to see you. After all, the Church wouldn't like a busybody priest who harasses a fair-goer instead of doing what he has to do... whatever that is."

    " I turn away. Walk away. And laugh like mad."
    "Perhaps I've well and truly gone mad. And that is good: Hanes has apparently counted on every possibility..."
    "Every possibility, except me behaving like I've got a few screws loose."
