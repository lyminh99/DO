    Az" Anatolio, Anatolio, my dear Anatolio... such an important choice... and you want to decide it on a coin toss?"

    " I scratch my head innocently."

    A" Uh... I don't think I can decide it otherwise. Why not let fate do it for me? Right? Right?"

    " Disappointed. That's all I can see from Azzurra's glance."
    "“Am I seriously betting my life on such an irresponsible lout?” Probably that's what she thinks.  "

    "I produce the one coin I do have in my pocket. A silver coin, the head bearing the Creator's scepter, the tail the image of a large tree."

    A" Head I'll go for Aurora. Tail, I'll not. You with me?"

    " Azzurra nods, so very unwillingly."

    A" Let's do this."

    " One..."
    "Two..."
    "Three.."
    "TOSS!"

    Az" Head... Head!"

    " Azzurra sounds almost unreasonably happy."
    "Well, it is a head. The image of the Creator's staff flashes in my eyes. Looks like the Creator Himself wishes I do this. For a reason only He knows."
    "Alright. Alright then. Alright then, Anatolio."
    "Does it look like I have any choice in this matter? Oh wait, I did. I turned it down."

    Az" So... will you keep your words, Anatolio?"

    " Calm down, Anatolio! If you're to walk this road, let's do so positively. Happily... Productively!"

    A" Let's do it!"

    " A smile unconsciously forms on my face."

    A" Because I am Anatolio Pietro, and I get things done!"

    " Azzurra sounds more disappointed as she's ever been."
    "That's indeed the case. The image of the tree flashes in the morning light, as if teasing us both, more so Azzurra than me."

    A" That's probably for the best."

    " And then something clicks within me. Yes, this is the way it has to be!"

    A" But!"

    "I probably do."

    Az"  The future, huh…"

    " Her eyes meets mine, and glows with a twinkle."
    "And underneath that blonde curtain, I can see her smile – Azzurra's smile, bright and cheerful, as I'd like her."

    show Azu P11 at center
    Az" I... like the sound of that."

    " In her eyes I see a new dawn. The future. And happiness. All of them, and more, fills me with more joy than words can cover."
    "Sorry, Aurora. You've been good, but I've found something better."

    A" … I do think we can skip that “introducing my significant other to my parents” step, can't we?"
