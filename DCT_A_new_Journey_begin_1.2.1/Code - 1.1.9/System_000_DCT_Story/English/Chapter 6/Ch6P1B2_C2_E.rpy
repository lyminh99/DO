    A" I'm... sorry, sir. I... didn't find anything."

    Pa" Truly?"
    A" I'm afraid so."
    A" I didn't have enough time. I could only save Azzurra from that place!"

    " For a long while the man looks at me, a scowl on his face – just for a second or so."
    "Just enough to let me know: I've failed."

    Pa" I see."
    A" I... am sorry."

    Pa" My fault, not yours. I tasked you with a job too tough."

    " An euphemism for “You're a disappointment”. So subtle, yet so biting."

    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa" But never you mind. You saved Azzurra without causing further trouble. Not all failures are created equal, thankfully."
    A" Then... what would you have me do next?"
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" Nothing."

    Pa" Though I would watch my steps if I were you. "

    Pa" Sorry to say, but given the last incident I can't quite protect you if things happen."
    A" Things?"

    Pa" You're being watched, sans good feeling, by Church and a good part of Aurora alike. Enough said."
    
    "A hand falls on my shoulder before I feel the heat drain from my face."

    Pa" Look at you."

    Pa" Breathe in. Breathe out. Steady yourself!"
    
    "Unconsciously I do as I am told."

    Pa" Calmed down yet?"
    A"  … Sir."

    " My head is spinning. I thought I can literally see pieces of reality peeling away. They might as well be: if my screw-up is as bad as I think it is."

    Pa" Alright. Hear me out. This is what you absolutely have to do now: Attend the ceremony. Pretend nothing has happened."

    Pa"  If you cause no more trouble in the festival, on my honor, all will be well."
    A" But what of Azzurra? She still doesn't-"
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" Never you mind about that."
    A" But why? She's not out of trouble yet!"
    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa" To most people I'd say 'you'll thank me when the time comes'. But I know you won't like hearing that."
    A" ..."

    " I really want to protest, but then my inner wisdom is shouting “You and whose army?”"

    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" So I will tell you that Azzurra is being protected. By whom and how? That's a matter of utmost secrecy."
    
    "He pats me on the shoulder."
    
    Pa" Now if you are truly worried about Azzurra, then behave as per normal tomorrow and cause no trouble. Otherwise you'd be breaking things rather than mending them."
    
    "He must have seen my woes by now, and therefore his words sounds like both a reassurance... and something of a warning."
    
    A"… I see."
    
    "It is difficult enough for a very burdened Anatolio Pietro to breathe out as much."
    "Burdened by guilt, and without much to bargain with."

    Pa" Do what I say, and you still have room to prove yourself."
