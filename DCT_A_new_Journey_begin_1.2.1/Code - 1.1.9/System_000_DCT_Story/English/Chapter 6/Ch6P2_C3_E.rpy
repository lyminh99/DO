    " Morning of the Day. Anatolio, reporting in."
    "All... is not well."

    nvlDC"If someone had told me two week ago that there would be a time my parents' shouting would sound so surreal, I would have laughed him off."
    nvlDC"\n And now, here I am, looking at and listening to everything as if they were all otherworldly. Like I've gone to a new world with new worries and challenges, and forced now to look back at the world I have left, and those still stuck in it."
    nvlDC"\n But to focus on the positive: The streets are so beautiful today. So beautiful as to be contradictory to how I am feeling. Not positive at all, now to think about it."
    nvlDC"\n The festival shall take place at the central piazza. Every road leading there has been elegantly decorated: flowers and banners and the sign of the Holy Light."
    nvlDC"\n They've put up a series of great arches along the main street. Not a scrap of litter anywhere, nor a single open shop. Every eyes are supposed to be on a large stage at the center of the piazza, under which a huge altar has been erected under the great statue of the Creator's Court."
    nvlDC"\n The Creator Meyr stands in the middle of the statue, his great blade pointing down at the altar. Looks like I shall be standing right about there. He shall be the judge as to whether I am deserving of being human or not."
    nvlDC"\n To think of it, one of the most sacred moment in a person's life is supposed to be the scariest. Being a grown and accepted citizen, well, that's meant to be a privilege, not a right, and can be revoked if you do not live up to it."
    nvlDC"\n But then it's not all gloomy and stiff-necked, you see."
    nvlDC"\n The shops that have closed? Well, that's because lots and lots of little tents have been put up around the altar. Ceremony for us and a grand fair for the rest: food and games and fun, and even tents where venerable fathers would take the time to debate the sacred scripture to the pious who would hear their theological thoughts."
    nvlDC"\n The aroma of sweets and pastries and flowers and perfumes and sacred candle... You've got to be there to know such atmosphere does exist in this boring mortal coil."
    nvlDC"\n Everyone can enter the piazza as they please, though the grand stage is barred to all until the moment. A dozen ceremonial Templars in mail and tabard and all the panoplies of war stand guard, still as a row of live-sized statues."
    nvlDC"\n For a while I stand before the grand stage. It's still rather early, but I'm still joined by some dozens my age: male and female, thin and pudgy, dwarvishly short to twiggily tall..."
    nvlDC"\n Once every so often one would nervously approach the guards and show their medals. “Come back later” was all they got. That's right, we're all too early."

    H" Look who's paying me a visit!"
    A" … Hanes."

    "Looking at Hanes as a foe rather than a friend is strange, to be honest. No, he's not meant to be my foe. Just... a wretch, To be pitied."
    " A wretch who, nevertheless, can do immense damage if given half the chance."

    H" L-look at you, Anatolio. 'Tis a h-happy day, and you? Not looking t-too happy? Why not?"
    A" Come to mock and gloat, eh, Hanes?"
    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" S-still t-thinking about t-the unnecessary, no?"
    A"  …"
    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" I-I-I've told you! I'm an ex-executor of a s-superior will! "
    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H"A-are you seriously d-demanding me to dis-disobey a d-direct order?"
    A" Nice joke, Hanes. Doesn't take a genius to tell you're pulling strings here."
    A" Dare you look us in the eyes – Azzurra and me – and swear you're only an innocent executor?"

    " Hanes' tiny eyes widen. He shakes his head, and begins to giggle."

    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" T-the joke was y-yours, Anatolio!"
    show Azu Hanes P2 at center
    H"  W-why would s-someone like me sw-swear a sacred oath ov-over nothing? That's just dis-disdain for the Creator!"
    A" You know what this will do to Azzurra, and you play your part in it anyway. Where's your conscience, huh? Eaten by vengeance?"
    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" Call it what you like. Oh, just a friendly reminder, the ceremony will begin in just a bit. You going in, or not? I mean you, not Azzurra, but that's so obvious it's insulting! To your intelligence!"

    " Must. Not. Punch. Him. In. The. Face."
    "Yeah, that would just be counterproductive. I've thought quite hard over the past few days: not counting divine providence Hanes is the only one who can give Azzurra the salvation she deserves."
    "Against all hatred I stare him in the eyes."

    A"  Hanes."
    show Azu Hanes P2 at center
    H" Mmm? Something's on your mind, my dear genius?"

    " He knows this. That's why he's trying to tick me off, that must be it. But I can't do that. I can't cause trouble right now, for my loved ones' sake. For Azzurra."
    "And then my eyes meet the two attendants on his side, and a plan springs up in my mind. A hare-brained one... but that's all I have."

    A" How long have we known each other?"
    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" … Ten years. Eight months. Twenty days and four. One hour and thirteen minutes as we speak."

    " I nod. If not for his newly acquired taste for power, Hanes could very well have become a mathematician – a better one than me, anyway."

    A" I have always helped you. Saved you from bullying. My parents consider you the second son they've never had."
    A"  I never held any back from you – food to toys to my blood, toil and sweat."
    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" That's a long time ago... and you probably didn't mean me any good anyway. Like I said."
    A" But a good turn is a good turn. Surely the Creator dictates you would owe me a debt of some sort, wouldn't He?"
    
    "Hanes roll his eyes, as if asking “Are you serious”?"
    
    H" Well, much as I hate to admit... you are right. I do owe you."
    
    "Bingo. Show of hands, now!"
    
    A" If I asked you for some repayment, what would you say?"
    
    "For a second, his stare intensifies. But then he draws a deep breath: the two attendants are looking at him intently."
    "Of course they would. The Creator extols two virtues most of all: Mercy, and gratefulness. Hanes' pomp and newfound arrogance is working against him."

    H"  … Anatolio."
    show Azu Hanes P2 at center
    H"  Ana, Ana, Anatolio... H-how dare you…?"
    A" Why would I not? If that is how you want it to be..."

    " Show of hands, Anatolio."

    A" Azzurra getting in, in exchange for clearing all debts – neither of us owing the other anything from today on. What say you?"

    "Hanes swallows hard. He's not looking at me now, but rather at his fellow clerics. They're actually watching him closely, with about as much interest as I am showing. Which is to say, a lot."

    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" Hah! Nice joke, Anatolio. Nice joke, that is!"
    A" Not a joke this time. What do you say?"
    show Azu Hanes P2 at center
    H"  …"
    show Azu Hanes P2 at center
    H" Alright. Let me ask you. What do you want me to say?"
    A" ..."
    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" I can't say yes. You know it, don't you?"
    A" Look me in the eyes and say no if you can!"
    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" … Well, er..."
    
    "I place a hand on his shoulder. Just like the old times, I think. Let's pretend everything is like they should be, and nothing has changed between us."
    
    A" I've trusted you, Hanes. I still do. I still can't blame you after all this."
    A" If your conscience remains, you will help me. For me, for Azzurra, and for the love of the Creator."

    " Hanes looks at me. Mumbling something."

    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H"  Ha. Ha ha… Ha ha ha ha ha!!"

    " Hanes throws my arm off."

    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" That's a good one. Smart, as always, when you need to be."

    " Hanes' plans have never been perfect perfect, so that's no astonishment there."

    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" True. I can do something. But not something for nothing."
    A" What do you have in mind?"

    " He pats me on the shoulder."

    show Azu Hanes P2 at center
    H" How much would you give up for Azzurra?"
    A" As much as I can afford."
    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" Be more precise. Money? Time? Blood? Limbs? Or your very life and soul?"
    A" To the point, Hanes."
    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" Here's the rule: "
    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" If someone doesn't receive the invitation, that means the Creator's Court have not accepted them from the very beginning. But if someone is to make the final sacrifice for that person..."
    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" So, if someone about to undertake the ceremony would give up their own rights to humanity for the damned soul... "
    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" well, They would give the wretch a second chance."
    
    "Now how do you ever justify something so senseless as that?"
    
    A" You're making that up!"
    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" Wish I were."
    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" Apotheosis, 8:31. Line three through five. Should have read the scriptures while you could."

    "The sound I just hear was something breaking deep within me."

    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" So, my dear old friend? How about that? Choice's yours..."

    " Hanes turns his back to me."

    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" You dare not. Of course you don't."

    " I'm not answering. More like I can't. No, more like I daren't."

    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" Read you like a book."
    A" Hanes... you are scum."
    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" Pot calling kettle black. I am trying to help you, Ana. I am your true friend right here, while Azzurra... remind me where she is again?"
    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" But enough empty words. Time's not your friend today, no? Make your choice – then I can do what I can. Otherwise..."
    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" But... know this, Anatolio my friend... we can still be friends. I've had no quarrel with you."
    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" You've largely been good to me while you aren't too busy being a jerk."
    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" So I tell you this: Forget about it. Attend the ceremony. Your intelligence will be useful to society. "
    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" All will be well. Mark my words!"

    " He pats me on the shoulder... then disappears behind the row of Templar guards with a long string of laughter."

    H" Take care, friend."

    " All the muscles on my face tremble."
    "Wretch."
    "And Azzurra, where are you? What the heck is Father Fredo doing?"
    "No time to think twice! I must find Azzurra first; everything else comes later!"
    "Which means... only one place to go now!"
