    "I find myself back at home, where a nap beckons. It then takes Mom quite a few holler to rouse me enough for supper."
    "What a tiring day."
    "I swear, from now on an afternoon walk is not worth it any more. No sir."

    "Who's calling me?"

    C0" Anatolio."

    "Mom, let me sleep for a bit more. Will wake up tomorrow."

    C0" Anatolio."

    "No, no, not Mom. Clearly a man's voice, albeit a little too high."

    C0" Anatolio. Anatolio. Anatoliooooooooooooooooooooo"

    C0" A-Anatolio."

    A" Insomnia again, Hanes?"

    "Let me introduce. Hair white as snow. Collar never folded. That's my friend Hanes in all his glory."

    H" N-nope! Why'd y-you think that?"
    A" Just a guess. So what are you looking for me for?"

    "My stuttering friend has seemingly vanished from plain sight since they admitted him into the Church's junior clergy. "
    "Now he appears again, right here. Is this some kind of bad omen or something?"

    H" N-nothing too special."
    A" Then do excuse me. Bed beckons."

    H"H-hey! W-wait up! I-I have something to dis-discuss!"

    "The Creator have mercy upon Hanes and his albino self – it has been causing him no ends of trouble since he was born. "
    "Even now when he has grown up, his snow-white hair is still a common source of grievance. "
    "It is only when Father Fredo admitted him into the clergy as an acolyte did things get a little better."
    "But then, there's the fact that he's disappeared – more or less – since then."

    H"Well, here's the-the matter. We haven't seen ea-each other for a while now, r-right?"
    A" Not like I don't remember, pal."

    H" H-here's the deal. My bi-birthday is next Sunday. S-so, well, er... you two wa-want to come over for a p-party?"
    A" Sure, sounds nice. Where?"

    H" The cathedral."

    H" W-what's wrong?"
    A" Why hold a birthday party at the cathedral? You outta your mind?"

    H" What's wr-wrong with that? That's where m-my room is!"

    "Hanes tilts his head, as if deep in thoughts"
    "Hanes has never been the sharpest cleaver on the rack. That, and his rather lackluster exterior haven't done him much favor in making friends."
    "A far cry from your sincerely, who does enjoy a fair bit of love and attention from everyone else."
    "At least, I like to tell myself that."

    A" Is that so? Well then, that's fine. Off you go?"
    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" Eh? B-but-"

    "I don't know why – I just know I bolted the door shut behind me as if taking advantage of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Not even his “Could I have some water” plea got through my ears."
    "Just ignore him, I think. That's done and done. He can get some water back at his place."
    "As for me? As the saying goes, do not today what you can procrastinate till tomorrow. Sounds like perfect advice. I'm back to sleep."
    "What a tiring day."
    "I swear, from now on an afternoon walk is not worth it any more. No sir."
