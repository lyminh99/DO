    C0" Good afternoon, Ana. Once again, Elena runs into Ana"
    A"Elena…"

    " That kind of mannerism... there's only one person on the face of this green earth I know of. "

    " Hiding behind the shoulders of the muscular footman, the petite girl moves forward, dusting her golden hair. "
    " Her hair, for that matter, looks not dissimilar to Azzurra's, though longer and more delicate. The strands roll on both side into classy folds, "
    " a far cry from Azzurra's simplistic beauty. The way they clip her hair, too, is extremely stylish. And if you are to look closer, "
    " you probably can't take your eyes off her gothic red dress, sewed with golden threats sparkling in the sunlight."
    " Let me introduce to you Elena De'Rovere: the friend I've made since my eight birthday – our eight birthday. "
    " The years have been nothing but extremely kind upon her, and here she stands, a splendid lady beyond my wildest imagination."
    " She extends her hand towards me: a small, soft hand with long fingers as opposed to Azzurra's thick and short ones. "
    " Her pink fingernails were painted gold, sparkling and shining under the drops of late sunlight."
    " My biggest mistake this time around turns out to be actually accepting her help. I was just about to praise her, when her fingers let go of me. "
    " Poor dear Anatolio falls with yet another thud. And it hurts. A lot."

    A"Hey, what are you doing, letting go like that?"
    E"Mmm. Elena apologizes. Let Elena help Ana up again."

    A"Nope, nope and nope. I'll stand up myself, thank you very much."

    " Has anyone told her how scary she is when she actually smiles?"

    E"Teehee. When a man falls, he has to stand up, staring into the endless blue sky as he does. Isn't it songworthy?"
    A"Look who's talking."

    E"La la la…"

    " A song escapes Elena's lips. If I remember correctly, that is the melody of Vivaldi's Allegro.  "
    " Her fingers steepled in front of her, looking terribly friendly and innocent, especially in conjunction with her current face."
    " You know what they say about not taking a girl's innocent-looking smile at face value? "
    " Roses do have thorns, much less this young lady here, whose dress might as well have been made of thorns."

    E"Ana? Why is Ana looking at Elena like that? Elena feels like blushing!"
    A"Ah, no. No. Nothing."

    " I couldn't help but be drawn to how gorgeous she is. Just like every other time we've met."
    " Elena has a manner of speech particular only to her, that is way, way different from everyone else's. "
    " It probably isn't even one particular to her family, since I've yet to hear anyone from her household talking like that. But then that hasn't surprised me."
    " That's the Elena I know, the Elena who always knows how to differentiate herself from the rabbles around her."

    E"Teehee."

    " See, looking at me standing up with a painful posterior, she is still laughing. Look, look, there she laughs again! I know it!"

    E"Elena has a question. What has Ana been up to?"
    A"Why ask? You saw it all."

    " Speaking of which. Where is the book? It was in my hands just now."
    " Well I was knocked a bit away – and that's where the book's probably gone-"
    " Hold on a sec."

    A"Azzurra?"

    " Azzurra is not there any more."

    A"Azzurra!!!"

    " When I turn around, the girl's already off in the distance with the book in her hand. "
    " Apparently she'd snatched it from my hands while I was flat-footed there."

    E"Hi hi…"

    " Elena's sinister smile is enough hint as to what has actually happened."
    " I don't care if it is her joke or not. I have to mend my error, like now!"

    A"Azzurra. Stop, stop!"

    " I leap back on my foot, just about to chase after her."

    E"Would Ana please hang on for a second."
    A"?"

    " My collar contracts – before I could react, one of the two footmen towering over me has already lifted me off the ground such that I can only feel the tip of my toes on the ground."

    E"Is the lovely Ana just going to leave like that? Dear Ana?"

    " Her voice is disdainful before the victim that is me."

    A"Right, right, I get it. Now can you please let me down?"
    E"If Ana prefers. "
    A"Ana Schmana. First Azu, then you. Haven't I told you I hate that name? "
    A"Look, we're all grown up now. Don't I deserve a more fitting name? "

    " Or one that doesn't make me sound too wimpy."

    E"Well, Ana does call Ms. Ines 'Azu'."
    A"That's different. Harmless!"

    " But to an extraordinarily handsome and talented individual like your sincerely who is yet single, well, it's not harmless any more."

    E"Elena finds it alright, isn't it? Elena-Ana. Elena-Ana. Like a match made in heaven!"

    A" WHAT DO YOU MEAN A MATCH!!!"

    " Fact of the matter is, Azzurra isn't the first person to call me so. Ever since our first meeting, Elena has been quite fond of shortening my name. "
    " I've been complaining for the sake of complaining – having gotten used to it anyway. "

    E"Ana không cần khẩn trương thế đâu. Nè! Elena có quà tặng này."

    " The man from before takes one step back. Behind Elena another footman approaches. "
    " Now three in total, each and every of them has that fierce appearance about them that I don't want to look at them any more than I have to."
    " What does stand out is that they are clad from top to toe in black."

    E"Here. Would Ana mind having a look-see?"

    " A page from a gazette? "
    " Obviously. The page has been cut out from the local “Vir Sanctus”. Probably the latest issue: the smell of ink is fresh and warm. "
    " Which is good, too: I haven't actually checked out today's newspaper."
    " Wait a sec. Isn't this..."
    " TOMORROW's issue?"
    " That's not actually surprising on second thoughts. Knowing who Elena is (and who her father is), "
    " it isn't all that remarkable for her to grab a copy one day before."
    " But why show it to me?"
    " Let's have a look."

When approached, he stated his reason for this most reprehensible assault to be “Just 'cause”. This is clearly a dangerous behavior and should be eliminated from civilized society-"

    NDO" My pleasure, m'lady."
    E"Isn't it good, Ana? In this paper, Ana has taken vengeance on Elena's swipe just now!"
    A"So the redacted part was on purpose?"
    E"But of course. At first Elena intended not to censor the name, but then the editor said it would be too obvious. "
    E" Took Elena quite a while to persuade him, too. What a bother!"

    A"I see."
    E"Ana is so smart isn't he?"

    " What a lovely smile, Elena. What a good way to go, Anatolio. Not everyone gets to be seen off by the face of an angel."

    A"Though we aren't truly childhood friends, we have known each other for long enough. "
    A"I was wondering, if the Lady Elena De'Rovere would spare the humble Anatolio Pietro a small favor?"
    E"?"

    " Elena tilts her head. Hesitated. This is probably not in her original plan."

    A"Something of utmost importance."
    E"?"

#//Elena nghiêng đầu.

    A"Pen my last will and testaments."

    " That it should come to this terribly important thing. Yes, a good time for it too: what a beautiful sunset. "
    " Am I not proud that my body and soul gets to melt into the last drop of a day's sunlight. "
    " Duskfall, the light of ruin, the light heralding the Eventide, the light promising a distant rebirth. "
    " A pity it is, that said rebirth shall have not a place for me."
    " You who hear my speech, lend me your ears and do me a favor. "
    " Tell my parents I am sorry. What a costly mistake this has turned out to be."


    E"Aha. Ahahahaha."
    A"Why are you laughing?"
    E"Teehee… So after all those years knowing Elena, Ana is still so... ridiculous. So silly. Isn't he? Ahahaha."

    "Elena's knees tremble with her every laughter. The two footmen, diligent as they are, have to prop her up with all haste."

    A"So... you haven't actually sent that thing to the print?"
    E"Not without Ana's consent, no! But if Ana wills Elena so-"
    A"No, no, no, no, no. No! Please!"

    " Can't be so sure who's the fool in this business."

    E"Elena agrees not. What will Elena get for doing as Ana says?"

    " Elena tosses her hair."

    A"Um…"

    " Just as planned. I needed only feign the vulnerable guy, and Elena has to give way. Once again."
    " I should be candid at this point: I know she has only the heart to make me mad. "
    " But if I should make her mad... well, let's not get to that. Time for a concession or two."
    " In any case, it was silly enough getting mixed up in this. I need to rethink matters. "
    " From now on, I'll just stay at home in the afternoon. What say you? Go out there, learn something new? "
    " Bah! I've learnt enough, that's why I'll stay right where it's safe!"


    E"Well, Elena won't send this to the print, no. But in return... isn't it fair that Ana does Elena a wee favor?"
    A"A... favor? Right! I mean... yes! Anything!"
    A"Wait a sec. You AREN'T going to have me commit suicide, are you?"
    E"Rest easy, Ana. Elena shall not make him commit suicide."
    A"Murder someone then?"
    E"Or homicide."
    A"Robbery."
    E"Nope."
    A"Arson."
    E"Nah."
    A"Kidnapping?"
    E"Nor illegally taking anyone hostage."
    A"Elena is pretty."
    E"Many thanks!"
    A"Well... you know what I am thinking, don't you?"
    E"Matter of fact, Elena does!"
    E"Ana is... odd, isn't he? A classy lady so well-mannered like Elena, how can she stomach to force Ana to do such ugly things?"

    "Yes, yes and yes. That so-well-mannered-and-classy lady has just, if memory serves us all well, had her footman kick me aside. Now she's upon me and whispering in my ears."
    E"Elena just wants Ana to “explain” why Ana was bullying Azu just now."
    " I feign ignorance. "
    A"Wait, what?"
    "No, make it real ignorance. You've just helped Azzurra run away, what else do you want out of me now?"

    E"I'm being a bother, my good man, but-"

    " Elena turns to the footman waiting on her."

    show Azu Unknow P0 at center
    NDO" Yes, M'lady. I'll send the manuscript to the press at once."
    A"Wait, no! I'll say it, okay? I'll say it."

    " I have no choice but to tell Elena all that I can. With some omissions, of course. For my own good."

    E"Ah, so it is said. So that's why you groped her."

    " She said that without a change in her expression"

    A"What groping? I was just going for the book!"

    " To be honest, I was probably overstepping limits at that point. Then again, I was only thinking about the book."
    " Do the right thing, they said. It will be good, they said."

    E"Elena thinks Ana should apologize."

    " Elena stares dagger at me. As if it were her own business. Look how the cold young lady evolved into a considerate and caring protector to her friend."

    A"Alright. Fine. I'll go apologize, alright?"

    " I have to make a concession. Then again, I was kinda sorta in the wrong."

    E"That's Elena's Ana!"

    " Elena's expression shifts instantly. There's probably less than a dozen in existence who can do what she does."

    A"Anatolio: And the book. You going to let Azu just... hold on to it?"

    A"THAT'S THE CRUX OF THE MATTER! You're going to let Azzurra get away with thievery?"
    E"Who told Ana Ms. Ines was stealing?"
    A"Taking a book without paying – if that isn't stealing, it must be daylight robbery."

    " Not that I oppose teaching the Ascenderos couple a lesson or two-"

    E"What if she has already paid?"
    A"That would be good... if she had money to afford it in the first place! That's why she has to give it back."
    E"Elena said, what if the book has been paid for."
    A"Don't play me for a fool. I'm not paying, Azu isn't paying. Not gonna happen unless the bookstore owner gives her for free."
