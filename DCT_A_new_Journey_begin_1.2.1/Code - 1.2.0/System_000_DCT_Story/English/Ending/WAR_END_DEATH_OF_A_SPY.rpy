    " Three years later."

#Cảnh: Elena đứng trên đồng cỏ, cạnh một ngôi mộ, tay cầm một quả mặt cười. Bầu trời đầy mây đen, có một vài cụm khói cuộn lên trời.
    " One year later."

    E" I still don't understand what truly happened that day. Nobody does."
    E" I only know, that I would never see Ana again."
    E" Azzurra; the Azzurra Ines that we know, vanished also."
    E" In a way, that was good. For Azu and Ana, this world is not meant to be theirs in the first place."
    E" The peaceful world that I knew... that they knew, has died also. The time of bliss ends, in its place an era of renewed strife."
    E" I'm no longer the heiress to the Duke's estate, as the Duke himself no longer exists, a casualty among so many."
    E" In this tug of war between the Church and those who would see them overthrown, who would win? Is there any difference?"
    E" The dead do not come back, no matter who declare themselves the new masters of this cursed world."
    E" But I, well, I remember who they are. What they are. "
    E" I shall bring those memories to the grave, as I will my diary and my many questions left unanswered."

    E" Does it matter if I never get to know?"
    E" More importantly..."
