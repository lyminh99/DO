    A" No means no. Rules are rules."

    "After a while thinking matters over, I still can't convince myself how letting the city idiot into the group can be remotely helpful to our cause. "
    "At least, if Hanes has some kind of potential, I'm not seeing it."

    AZ" Then you're no longer my friend!"
    
    "Well, there's that “consideration” too. Except it's less that and more “duress”. Azzurra's the reason that makes things much less black and white than I'd like in cases like this."
   
    A" Do you have to put it that way?"
    show Azu P32 at center     
    AZ" Yes, I have! The more the better, right? If Hanes joins, we'll have other benefits too!"
    A"  What benefit? Tell me and I may reconsider."

    AZ" You said it!"
    A" : You have my word, m'lady."

    " Me thinks Azzurra has nothing. Just like every other time. Hence my declaration, loud and clear."

    AZ"  Look, Hanes is a man of the Church, right?"
    A" Right you are."

    " Yet another reason I have to be cautious about him."
    show Azu P45 at center
    AZ" Doesn't that make it easier to conceal our work with him around?"
    A" Why so? Are you crazy?"
    show Azu P38 at center
    AZ" Anatolio's the crazy one. Know that saying, “The most dangerous place is the most dangerous place?”"
    A" Now who the hell came up with that?"

    "Well, with Hanes working for us, we'll have information on the Church from the horse's mouth itself, like if they're suddenly out looking for books to burn or something. "
    "Even if they do find out about us, we've got a friend in the high place. "
    "He'll help us go to the outskirts more easily, get water samples... "
    "even to the far North if need be!"

    AZ" You know... things are really tense of late. Isn't it better to have some friends to help us out?"

    H" Uh... actually I don't kn-know all that much about- OUCH!"

    " Hanes was obviously trying to say something when he yelps. Then his mouth seals up as he rubs his backside. Looks like it hurts. A lot."

    A" Hmm. That... does make some sense."

    "True. Azzurra's logic is quite persuasive. Have I been a little too pessimistic about Hanes' prospects?"
    "Well then. Should I let him in, this time around?"
