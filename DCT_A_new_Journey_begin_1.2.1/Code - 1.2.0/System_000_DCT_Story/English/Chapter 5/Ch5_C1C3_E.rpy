    "I can think of nothing but to lie. I have to lie: Elena doesn't need to know what I need to do... what I will do."
    "I clench my fist. It's not out of selfishness that I'm hiding it from her, but for her own good. Elena doesn't need to know, and outright shouldn't know, much less intervene in the business of Aurora, or between Mr. Attenborough and myself."
    A" So... the Sun Festival is coming."


    "Elena rolls her eyes."

    E" It is! Shouldn't Ana be happy? We are going to be adults!"
    "Elena giggles. “We”, she said, and now she's pointing at her own medal. She's part of it too, I realize. She's going to be an adult, too, and takes that as a source of great joy. Just look at her smile!"
    A" Sure, that's how it should be, right? But... what if something happens?"
    E" Something? What does Ana mean by something?"
    "I scratch my head, and let loose the dog of imagination."
    A" What if something happens that, well, prevents us from attending the festival at all? A cold, an accident... or being kidnapped by chimaeras!"
    "That does not sound very convincing... Elena wouldn't have trouble piercing the falsehood, would she? Though, do I look like I have better options?"
    A" Or if we're actually there, but somehow can't finish the ceremony! Anything can happen, right, Elena? Anything can happen!"
    A" Or, or, or! If we're there, we've done our part, but the Creator and His Court for whatever reason we mortals cannot fathom, suddenly decide we aren't fit to be people! The Creator works in mysterious ways, doesn't he?"
    "I can't believe I can be so eloquent on an issue I've been indifferent to all my life. Perhaps my imagination isn't completely useless after all."
    "Elena, against all odds, is actually listening attentively! Could fit be that I have succeeded?"
    "… and then Elena starts laughing. Her petite right hand raises to her lips, and covers her mouth."

    E" Ana's imagination can be surprising at times, Elena thinks."
    "Now is she complementing or mocking me? How can I ever know? I can only try to make the best of what I have..."
    A" N-not imagination! Aren't these some really, really, really real threats to our existence as people?"
    A" If anything so unfortunate would happen to me, or to Hanes, or even to you, t-that would be abysmal, wouldn't it? And incredibly unfair, too!"
    "Elena's smile vanishes. Her hands fidget the medal on her chest."

    E" Elena doesn't think it would be so bad. Ana is just thinking too hard about it."
    A" Well, what it that happens?"
    E" Well, then we wouldn't be people any more... be wretched and nameless... worse than a shadow..."
    "Elena clenches her fist, and raises her voice."
    E" But so what? Ana has his parents, his family, Azzurra and Hanes! Isn't Father Fredo Ana's good friend, too? They will never, ever abandon Ana, no matter what!"
    "Then Elena's smile returns, but not a happy one. Elena's melancholy is contagious: I find my heart sinking, too."

    E" And Elena... Elena is used to it. Elena's life has been like a dream, Ana. A dream that can be as much euphoric as it is nightmarish."
    E" And what is Elena to do but accept everything to come her way? Is that not true, Ana?"
    "There is so much Elena's smile is keeping hidden behind the facade that my head feels like exploding. My dear Elena, do you need to be such a mystery all the time?"
    "I suddenly feel a terrible pang of guilt. Have I said something I should not? Have I somehow offended her? What am I to say now?"
    A" Oh, well, I'm not entirely serious anyway. Perhaps nothing will happen, y'see?"
    "I put up the most serious and reliable-seeming mask I have in me."
    A" Well, I am worried, sure, but doesn't everyone, the Creator included, want to see our world filled with a fresh, happy and useful young generation? They will do whatever they can to make sure nothing happens, I sure hope?"
    "Elena stares at me. And then her smile again morphs into laughter."

    A" Wait, did I get something wrong? Why are you laughing?"
    E" Because Ana can be so silly, right? That argument? That's Elena's line! Ana doesn't need to try to persuade Elena to believe what she's already believed in!"
    "Butter my behind and call me a biscuit..."
    A" I... I mean..."
    E" Well, what Elena means is that Ana is worrying over absolutely nothing! How about Ana go take a walk with Elena? Some fresh air and walking would do Ana's head a lot of good! Shall we?"
    A" T-that's not necessary, thank you. B-besides, I'm kinda... sorta... preoccupied."
    E" Preoccupied?"
    A" Things to buy, for my parents. For the Festival. Y-you see, family business and all..."
    "Again, not very convincing. Elena still looks me from top to toe. But then, perhaps finally getting bored of tormenting me..."
    E" Well, then. Don't let Elena stop Ana. Elena will see Ana at the Festival then."
    "Elena waves her hand."
    E" Oh, and Ana doesn't need to tremble so much. Elena will keep an eye out for Ana's קוֹמֶדִיָה till the very end..."
    "Is that supposed to be a threat?"
    "I don't know. I do know I've got the break I've asked for, so let's just get out of here and be done with that!"
