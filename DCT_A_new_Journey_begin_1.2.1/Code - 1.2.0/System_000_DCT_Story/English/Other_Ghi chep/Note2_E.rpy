    nvlDC" \n The color of the wall matches the sunlight."
    nvlDC" \n The wall's matches the scarf's."
    nvlDC" \n And the scarf's goes well with faces pale."
    nvlDC" \n And so it is that the whole chapel has turned so monochrome in a Saturday morning, supposed to be so warm and colorful."
    nvlDC" \n He is certain not even the specks of seemingly animate dust can forget the happening about them."
    nvlDC" \n There the sunlight, then dancing on the white flowers blossoming about a brown-painted casket, then resting upon the most holy symbol of the Creator."
    nvlDC" \n Then it sings, too, in a  language of its own, in a silent symphony with the many bouquets lining around it. "
    nvlDC" \n A dirge as fine as any to welcome the man sleeping within back to the arms of the Creator."
    nvlDC" \n Somewhere above, the Creator is certainly watching on, His gaze peaceful. His presence graces his wayward child with that last peace he deserves. The All-Father and his lost son, now finally reuniting, that's how it is. That's how it's meant to be."
    nvlDC" \n Then the musical choir begins, in unison."
    nvlDC" \n And so a mortal man returns to the Creator."
    nvlDC" \n And so a believer journeys to the Paradise where he shall remain in eternal bliss."
    nvlDC" \n A parting hymn, most holy and exalted."
    nvlDC" \n That, at the very least, is how it is supposed to be."

    "“…………………..”"

    nvlDC" \n It sounded as if the choir is echoing over from the great Vitus itself far away."
    nvlDC" \n Father Fredo presented himself in a robe of black, as was his wont. He faced the altar, once every so often turning a glance at the congregation below. And then once every so often he'd sigh. Regret, of one sort or another, filled his presence."
    nvlDC" \n Dozens had already left while the rest were following the casket, some lifting it to the large funerary wagon. The three draft horses neighed, perhaps a little startled at the sheer number just as so many white petals from the bouquets drift to the ground. Quite a few kids, innocent and carefree as they are, leaped to grab them, looking at those petals so sacred as if they were mere toys. "
    nvlDC" \n As for the adults, some tried to stop them, others turned them a blind eye. That's how the departed man is, they say: generous and unfettered, and wouldn't fuss too much about the whole business."
    nvlDC" \n And then there were a few who remain behind. The road was long, and the walk wasn't too appealing for those who didn't know the departed man so well. They did hang around, however, talking about the fostered grandchild he's left behind."
    nvlDC" \n She was barely thirteen, they say, and had only been the deceased's foster granddaughter for a little more than a couple years. Throughout the ceremony, she stood there, wearing the funeral garbs, and neither spoke nor cried. "
    nvlDC" \n Behind her stood a young boy around her age, standing with his family. None has said a single word, or betrayed a single tear. They just stood there. Like demons petrified."
    nvlDC" \n Father Fredo stood to the left of the small trail. He remained solemn as he was supposed to be, and kept a close eye on everything. He wore no glass today, and almost forgot the holy hat he should always put atom his head. He'd also broken the flower vase before his friend's casket."
    nvlDC" \n It hadn't been a good day by all accounts. He was, after all, feeling his age."
    nvlDC" \n A Church official among the lot sent to assist Fredo with his task whispered something in his ears. They wanted to stay behind in the chapel to clean up the mess. Well, he couldn't blame them. They simply weren't involved enough to embark on a long and fruitless trek from one side of the river to the other for the sake of a man who didn't quite belong one way or another."
    nvlDC" \n So Father Fredo had nodded. Not that he had any better option, nor needed one."
    nvlDC" \n When the funeral wagon began rolling, only the fostered grandchild, the Pietro household, the wagon drivers, the funeral assistants and the priest himself remained with the departed. "
    nvlDC" \n And maybe some of the more curious elements of the general public."

    nvlDC" \n …Autov de o kuriov hmwn ihsouv cristov kai o yeov kai pathr hmwn o agaphsav hmav kai douv paraklhsin aiwnian kai elpida agayhn en cariti."
    nvlDC" \n parakalesai umwn tav kardiav kai sthrixai umav en panti logw kai ergw agayw"
    nvlDC" \n Thessalonica, 16- 17:2."
    nvlDC" \n And so the casket was lowered into the grave."
    nvlDC" \n And yet the old priest felt as if it was his own mind that was being entombed."
    nvlDC" \n He returned to the congregation, his hands now steadying, way more than they were when he was holding the holy book. “A mite heavy for his age, innit?” people said. He didn't exactly need those comments to know, every fiber of his muscle was already failing him in such age as he was."
    nvlDC" \n To speak no falsehood, he was in no small amount of jealousy. Not exactly befitting of a good shepherd, or even a good man of the faith by all accounts. "
    nvlDC" \n Maybe it would be less sinful if he admitted he was being jealous of himself. His very mind in particular was jealous of his aging limbs. It questions itself, if it had well and truly gotten old, and why his limbs got to be old while that mind of his remains so sharp. "
    nvlDC" \n And there it was, the ugly truth, that his body in all its flaws had been growing weaker while his mind remains true – and therefore tormented with the pains of old that never quite go away. That was far worse than any physical ailment, that he'd be so tortured by old tragedies and regrets. "
    nvlDC" \n Think of the tortures of an iron maiden saved for the most filthy of apostates, then make them worse, that's how he felt every passing moment. Not least being the sheer helplessness, that his arms and legs were as they are: cold and shaking."
    nvlDC" \n Jealous, too, was he of that good old chap sleeping six feet under. Ah, that blasted old fool, always being just better than he was from an age so tender. He'd been good at school, he'd been sharp, he'd been so free to do whatever he wanted."
    nvlDC" \n He recalled those lazy afternoons, where the kids would play tag around the Crooked Man's Bridge, once every so often tossing rocks at old Coco's fat hens prancing about. Well, at least the tossing rocks part was the late fellow's idea. "
    nvlDC" \n And who took the blame for the prank again? Not Tiziano, the tramp, who had ever been so swift on his feet, but Fredo himself and a couple of his then-innocent playmates. "
    nvlDC" \n It was no surprise that the boy who would become a priest in the distant future regularly wished his dastardly pal some sort of payback. Go to sleep, he'd wished, go to sleep and never wake up again and bring trouble to Fredo's lot."
    nvlDC" \n Now the blasted fellow has just done exactly that. "
    nvlDC" \n Just as he normally did, he'd left behind his everything, his worships, his research, and a whole lot of trouble and regret that is now Fredo's alone. Accursed old fool, part of the old priest mumbles."
    nvlDC" \n It might be easy to wipe off the tears on one's face, but not so much those that well up deep within. For whom he was weeping, Father Fredo didn't know for certain. He could only look to Creator, and pray for his infinite Mercy."
    nvlDC" \n Then he looked to the two children. The girl, orphaned and abandoned and without much of an identity. The boy, practically a grandson to his late friend. There they held in their arms the books that old Tiziano was penning."
    nvlDC" \n What did he write in that last moment of his life as his heart stopped? Tiziano's last sentence – his last words – still looked like a peculiarity to Massimiliano Fredo: Why, and how, was such an effort committed."
    nvlDC" \n “That's the book the man was writing just as he died. Poor girl.” whispered a widow. "
    nvlDC" \n Those who have lost loved ones tend to be more sympathetic than the faceless everyone."
    nvlDC" \n “It's all right,” he tells the widow. “Then he steps forward, to where the trees' shade cannot obscure his eyes."
    nvlDC" \n He looks to the deep blue sky."
    nvlDC" \n “Look, old pal,” Fredo smiled deep beneath his surface, “the sky remains blue, as does the girl you saved.”"
