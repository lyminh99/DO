    "“Father!” The little girl's voice rings out."
    "The father steps closer, taking the calm-measured step of a well-learnt man. "
    "His feet hobble, while his hands curl uncomfortably around the pinkish kitle in the likeness of a too-colorful butterfly."
    " Now the butterfly has been smudged, having earlier fallen into the mud, which smears a little on his cream-colored vest."
    "“There you go, dear,” he says, bending down just a little. His one hand gives her the kite, his other scruffling her hair."
    "“Thank you!” exclaims the girl."
    "“Don't indulge her too much, dear,” says the woman as she runs towards them. She eyes the girl sternly. "
    "“You too. Don't you think it's a bit much pestering your father to take you out kiting first thing in the afternoon?”"
    "The girl's joyful face sinks, and the father would have none of that."
    "“That's fine,” he says. “'Tis not everyday, that I get to be a pretty good father, no?”"
    "“Don't say that, dear,” says the woman. “You have never not been the finest father any child can ask for.”"
    "“That's right, Father! You're the very, very bestest!” says the girl, and let the butterfly kite take flight. "
    "“Please don't go any more, please? Pretty please?”"
    "“Seems like I hardly have any choice, do I?” "
    "“Promise? Promise!” "
    "“There, there, my little sapling, dear.”"
    "He is many things: a great man, a madman... and just a father at the end of the day."
    "No matter what the rest of the world thinks of him, he remains a father much beloved."
    "Is that not the only thing that matters?"
    "He looks at his baby girl chasing after the kite."
    "It is his happiest moment, and yet contradictorily his most tormented. Like two sides of an ironic coin."
    "So it is, that this trip has given his daughter just a bit of respite from the walls of the sanitorium. It's almost salvation – to her, and to him."
    "“Time's up.” whispers his wife into his ear."
    "“Time flies, doesn't it?” he says, and claps his hands. “Let's go, dear.” He taps on the girl's thin shoulders."
    "“We'll come again tomorrow,” he says."
    "“Really, Father?”"
    "“Why would I lie to you?” he says. “So rest assured, we'll take you back again, and again and again..”"
    "Then he kneels a little, turning his back to her. As if on cue, the little girl leaps on his back, clutching at his neck like an obedient puppy."
    "“Get well soon.” "
    "The man looks to the sky. “My dear Azzurra...”"
