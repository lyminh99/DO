    " Faltering again, you wretch."
    "What did you promise again, Anatolio?"
    "It was you who told Azzurra to stand up and resist her fate! You who said you'll be there with her!"
    "Oh, but it's easy to just bandy empty words, no? You're proud of your empty words, sure. You even give yourself the right to judge those who don't follow that sort of standards you set!"
    "And now you're backing from it all?"
    "You're no better than Massimiliano Fredo? Empty words, that's what."
    "No. That's not true."
    "That is not who I am."
    "Not that I dare not give up. Not that I cannot give up. I simply must not allow myself to fall."
    "That voice is right: I've condemned, silently or otherwise, Father Fredo and Hanes for what they did. Oathbreaking."
    "My oath is to take care of Azzurra. An oath to Father Fredo, to Gramps and to Azzurra herself."
    "And to myself, too."

    H" ....."
    A" You've been till a few days ago a good friend. That much's what I'll think, anyway, right or wrong. Either way, I'll not take your offer, thank you very much."
    A" I'm not going to give up on Azzurra. Not now, not ever."

    " I give him a courteous bow. As much courtesy as I can give him after all that."
    " He stands there, eyelids twitching. He draws a ragged breath, and looks at me with disappointment. Genuine disappointment."

    H" N-never have you f-failed me this much, all those years, Anatolio..."
    A" Hence the apology."
    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" Empty words, my former friend."

    " He shrugs, and turns away. “You will regret this, Anatolio,” is what he would say."
    "Regret? No stranger to that. And not one to surrender to it."
    "After all, such threats no longer hold any water to me..."
    "Because Azzurra is here with me."
    "Right-o!"
    "Azzurra has been staying so silent for the past few moments, after authorizing me to speak on her behalf."
    "I'd thought she's no longer around. Ran away, or left for home, too tired of the turn of events."
    "I steal a glance at her, as embarrassed as a guilty child probing his parents' reaction."
    "Funny, what have I done wrong to need such embarrassment? Well, that's indeed the case, whatever I may think."
