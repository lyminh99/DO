    " My feet take me out of the crowded festival and slightly less crowded main street. I cross the great bridge, cross so many streets that fly by my eyes..."
    "… and at long last, I am standing here, outside the chapel."
    "I half-expect the place to be empty. Normally you'd have a few elderly men and women on the bench praying and chanting, or discuss theology with Father Fredo if they feel like it. "
    "Today? It's off to the Festival with every one of them."
    "And then I realize, the place isn't as empty as I thought it should be"
    "Inside there are Father Fredo and… Azzurra. As my other half thought."
    "Father Fredo stands on the pulpit, where he normally is. Azzurra sits on the front bench, clasping her hand and bending her head. "
    "Everyone would take this for an average sermon for one extraordinary pious worshipper."
    "It is not."

    Az" No. If that were true, doesn't that mean the whole world is unlucky in one way or another?"
    A" Some more arcane stuff, Azzurra?"
    A" Let's think it simpler. Have fun. Eat well. Do what you like. Sleep like a spell. Life's good."
