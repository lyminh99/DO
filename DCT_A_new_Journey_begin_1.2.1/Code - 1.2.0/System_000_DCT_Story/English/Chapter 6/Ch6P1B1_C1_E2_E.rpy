    " My hand reaches for the back of my ear."
    "Never heard of that before, but I can try guessing."

    A"  Father Fredo's relative?"

    " Mr. Attenborough nods, and then shakes again."

    Pa" That'd be Massimiliano's brother. Can't you find a better friend."
    A" Oh. He must be an amazing man, isn't he?"
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" Was an amazing man. Got the Church issuing one warrant after another for his head, during that so-called inquisition of theirs. "
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" His nineteenth death anniversary is exactly one month ago."
    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa" Mind you, Massimiliano Fredo was not nicknamed The Massacrer for no reason. His company did terrible, terrible things to my friends..."
    A" I... am sorry, sir. I didn't know..."
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" Don't mention it. Part of my job is to remind the young such as you, of that tragic times,"
    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa"  and those nameless heroes who'd give everything to protect what they believe in."
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" And to remind those like you – and some older yet infinitely dafter souls – that you can't have peace with the Church."
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" But that's enough of that. Another day I'll let you know all there is to know about those dark days. Let's just say that much blood has been shed and many a life extinguished just to keep this place secret."
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" Your responsibility, and that of us all, is to protect this place at all cost for as long as you remain in the City."
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" I suggest not making a habit of coming here unless necessary. "
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" You don't want to draw attention to yourself, more than you've already."

    " The shudder grows stronger. Have I ever mentioned I do not envy those characters from mystery novels?"
    "Another heavy hand falls on my shoulder before I can well recover."

    show Azu Paul P3 at center
    Pa" Now, there, rest easy. We're no longer in those dark days twenty years ago. As long as you aren't too reckless, you'll do just fine."
    A" I sure hope..."
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" Let's make it this way: We'll see you again in a couple days' time. You'll know the details then."
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" Until then, I hope these will keep you occupied."

    " He points towards a rather large pile of very thick tomes on the table."

    A" This is..."
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" Quite a table full of food for thoughts, for starters. Literature and history and philosophy, and a few other things. "
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" Those intellectual values of that lost world we've somehow been able to keep safe."
    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa" Not unlike this secret room, blood had been shed so that you can read these pages of timeless wisdom today."

    " Now what have I to say about those books? One: Too thick. Two: Too obtuse, from the first page on."
    "The titles were telltale... except not quite: “Thus Spake Zarathustra”, “The Prince”, “Beyond Good and Evil”, “God is Dead”, “A Critique of Pure Reasons”, “The Metaphysics of Morals”..."
    "Those who penned these volumes were either supremely clever so as to be almost inhuman, or they'd done so while intoxicated. "
    "Reminds me of that time Mr. Ascenderos uttered much 'philosophical' musings with a bottle in hand. That was quite comedic.."
    "But no, it does seem that those who wrote these volumes took their works very seriously."

    A" I wonder... how long do I have to read all of this?"
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" Best case scenario? Your entire lifetime."

    " I stare at Mr. Attenborough. Is he joking? No, no, those eyes – so serious and so humorless. He definitely isn't."

    A" P-pardon me, sir?"
    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa" That's quite a lot of philosophy, right there. I've been a scientist and a part-time philosopher, so to speak, over the past thirty years."
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" What I have learned is: Philosophy without exact science would lack sanity. "
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" Exact science without philosophy would lack direction."
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" You want a way out? Then begin with both. "
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa"  You're still young: there's plenty of time."
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" Why, you'll even get to do things we couldn't."

    " True. I – no, we , Azzurra and I, we've got a task, don't we? Let's go out there, and find an answer for Azzurra's question. That's our goal."

    A"  If you say so, sir. I'll... I'll do my best!"
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" So I'll give this to you. Keep them safe."
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" You'd do well to learn from them. I-"

    " His lips moved just a little, and then stop."

    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" I have great hopes in you."

    " The room sinks back into silence. I have been staring at those books as if it was this kind of cursed gold: Mysterious, tempting... and so very scary."
    "Finally, I let out a deep sigh."

    A" May I have a look, sir?"
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" Do feel free."

    " And with that, my work begins in earnest."
    "In the distant future, am I to recall this moment, I can't quite determine how many pages I've flipped, or what exactly were on them."
    "I would only be able to recall one thing:"
    "On the very first page I flip, there are several lines of exceptionally neat handwriting:"
    "“Wer mit Ungeheuern kämpft, mag zusehn, dass er nicht dabei zum Ungeheuer wird."
    "Und wenn du lange in einen Abgrund blickst, blickt der Abgrund auch in dich hinein."
    "He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster."
    "And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee."
    "- Frederick Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil -”"
