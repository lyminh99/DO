    A" I'm afraid not, Father. With all due respect..."

    " I briskly step towards him."
    "What has lent me such decisiveness, I can't for the life of me say. "
    "I'm just about to commit an act of great disrespect to the divine – probably not seen since Geronimo the Apostate set fire to the statue of St. Lucina years before."

    F" Pietro! What do you think you are doing?"

    " Now I am but a few pace from the good priest. When he realizes exactly what I thought to do, I've already been closer to my prize than he can help it."
    "His fiery eyes did send shocks up my spine. Should I go on?"
    "No, I think to myself. I need to do this. I need to know this truth."
    "The priest hasn't given up yet. Quickly he dashes towards where I am. He's taller than me by a head, and way larger. I suddenly begin to pity those who opposed him during his Templar days..."
    "Well, but they are they. And I – a curious boy who grew up on his smarts – am I. More agile, and more alert.."
    "One jump, one dodge, one grab... and one long slide along the floor. The maneuver ends with a spectacular brake with both feet – if I say so myself."
    "Father Fredo missed me, and now I'm quite a way from him, behind the safety of the nearest table. And most of all, in possession of the thing he was going to just destroy just now."
    "Defeated for now, the priest stops, folds his arms and shakes his head."

    F"  Pietro... You... disappoint me."

    " Again my nerve cracks. Have I overstepped my bound?"
    "The answer is no. I have many – too many – questions to answer. And if I can find them here..."
    "Well, would it be worth it?  "
    "Then my glance meets Azzurra's gaze. She's been waving ever so slightly as if praising me. "
    "My boldness is rekindled, and I throw a “Do I look like I care?” look in the priest's direction."
    "Now, time to check out the prize I have won."
    "My initial hunch... was right."
    "I've only seen the first few sheets, but the sign of Aurora is there on pretty much every one of them. "
    "I don't have the time to actually read through them all, not with a rampaging mountain of a priest standing just a few paces from me."
    "But you only need a working brain to understand the implication of what I have just uncovered..."
    "Quickly I look up at the priest – partly to check if he's poising to tear me apart in one go."

    A" Father... So that is how it is?"

    " Fortunately, there is no violence in his look. There is only a soullessness in the way he shakes his head: His entire being seems to have withdrawn behind an iron shell in the blink of an eye."
    " And I am breaking out in cold sweat."

    A" You are dealing with Aurora! You do know what this means, don't you, Father?"

    F" Yes and no. The Church's embargo on the apostates only apply to the everyday citizens. "
    show Azu Fredo P3 at center
    F" The Templars are different. The Eyes of Light must not turn away before any and all ills – demons or apostates, heretics... or Aurora."

    " He shakes his head, and begins walking towards me – very, very slowly."

    F"  Try that again, Pietro... if you dare."

    " I back up, back up... and back up some more, till my back was to the wall. Behind me, Father Fredo walks still, his eyes burning through me."
    "My knees wobble. Have I turned the old priest into an enemy? Creator's mercy, what will happen to me?"
    "Suddenly the desire to find answers vanishes. I want nothing more to do with any of this but to get away from everything I've seen and heard."
    "The pile of document slips from my hand, and I hear the blurred noise of paper scattering all over the floor."
    "My head buzzes as I make out the shape of a dozen pieces of white and black painting the floor."
    "I may have seen something very, very familiar somewhere within, or I may not. I can't tell. I only know I'm in trouble, and that's it."

    C0" Well, well, well, what is going on here?"

    " The creaking door almost made my head explode. But then I saw Father Fredo stop. He turns around, and I can almost see his joints creak."
    "There I see a familiar mass of white hair atop a familiar head."
    "It is Hanes. Hanes, as important-looking as he has grown acquired to, wearing his initiate's robes that somehow makes him even more important-looking too."
    "He's just saved me a big one, whether he actually intended to or not. I would never have thought a day like this would come. And here it is."

    H" I came to discuss certain... matters with you, Father. Official business. "

    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" Involving an uninvited visitor no less!"

    " His tone sounds strangely acerbic today. Did something happen between Father Fredo and my friend here, that I don't know?"
    "Well, at least he bought me some time to catch my breath."
    "That's exactly what I do. I stand up straight..."
    "… and notice the sound of ruffling paper underfoot. I am stepping on one of the discarded documents."
    "I bend down and remove it from my sole. Crumpling the sheet into a ball seems like good catharsis – I'm in no mood to read; not now..."
    "And then the corner of my eyes catches a signature I've seen quite a few times throughout my childhood, at its bottom."
    "..."
    "Wait, what is this"

    A"  … Hanes?"

    " I blurt out."
    " My voice carries further than I thought it would: in seconds, I feel myself on fire. Every single eye in the room was on me."
    " I'm not sure what heats me up more: Those eyes, or the thing I'm skimming."
    " Hanes throws me a glance. He stops, just for a second. Then, as if having understood something very profound, he steps towards me – with a cold stare I never know he is capable of."

    A"  Do correct me if I'm wrong... pal."

    " My voice grows louder and more dramatic within a few words. My eyes roll: I must look like a judge delivering a sentence on the guilty."

    " Yet Hanes looks nothing like a convict whose judgement is being passed. He lifts the corner of his lips, and begins laughing."

    A" Why are you laughing?"

    " He doesn't answer. In fact, he turns away from me and towards Father Fredo – who has been since then staring at the ground like a man vanquished."

    H" As it happens, the Church and the Templars have so many ways to deal with evil and chaos. Believe me, you need not and do not want to know what they entail."

    H" And believe me when I say, those of the Eyes of Light have ways so... unmerciful, "

    H" to handle any and every apostate who would threaten the integrity of the Faith, or the holiness of the Church. "

    H" So, this one time, while they can do all that, instead they chose to trade the suspect to a group of people who value said person more than their own lives. "

    H" The condition is that nobody who matters gets hurt: clergy and citizens alike."
