    " Now it is my turn to stare back at the good priest."

    A" M-my apologies, Father, for all this – though I don't understand..."

    " The priest looks me in the eyes, then set the unburnt pile aside. "
    "Suddenly my spine freezes – those eyes are boring a hole through mine. 'You have done ill', I can almost hear his voice speaking as much."

    F" If I'm not mistaken, the Creator did teach man many things, and not entering someone else's abode unbidden is among them. "

    F" Am I, or am I not, Anatolio Pietro?"

    " Voice cold as ice. Brows furrowed. Jaws clenched. I begin to shiver: there exists a Father Fredo like this?"
    "But then my courage seeps back into me. No, I'm not here with malicious intents. I come here to beg for help. Not for me, but for Azzurra."
    "Is that not what the House of the Creator is for – a place for the needy and beleaguered to find reprieve if not salvation?"
    "I breath in hard, and more courage returns. My voice is shaky still, but that doesn't matter: I don't need to intimidate anyone, quite the contrary."
    "Whatever happens, happens.."

    A" Father... we need your help, if y-you are not unwilling..."

    F"  Oh?"

    " He looks at us again from top to toe. Us, as in me and Azzurra. His face mellows down, and the tranquil rage just now replaced by a deeply thoughtful look."
    "My glance alternates between Father and the pile of paper he's getting rid of. "
    "I don't have those elf-blessed eyes as in the fairy tales, but you don't need to be anything elven to recognize a particular sign on one of them."
    "Now I still haven't made up my mind, when Azzurra steps forward. Her face hardens and looks more severe than I've ever recalled."

    Az" Would the divine and the diabolic ever have to work together for a shared ideal, Father?"

    " Creator's mercy, what has happened to Azzurra?"

    A"  Azzurra! Cậu..."

    " Azzurra waves her hand and pushes me back – as though I were just a child who doesn't know what he's doing in the presence of adults.."

    Az" That is quite alright, Father. As you have trusted Gramps before, you can trust us. "

    Az" We aren't going to do anything against you... -"

    " Silence."
    "Such confrontational silence."
    "Such uneasy silence."
    "It only ends with Father Fredo's ragged sigh."

    F" Very well, Azzurra. Let me ask you this: If such a thing happens, does the mortal man need to know?"
    show Azu Fredo P0 at center
    F" There are things man aren't meant to know, Azzurra. "

    F" You would have understand this, if you truly understood my old friend."

    Az" And yet I have many questions, Father-"
    show Azu Fredo P0 at center
    F" Not all questions require answers. Besides, you've sought the wrong place. As I said: there are things you aren't meant to, nor should, know."

    " Dear me, dear me! Better speak up, Anatolio, before tall of this gets ruined!"

    A" I'm sorry, Father. Fact of the matter is, we come here today not for any answer, but rather to..."

    F" Find a place to stay, am I right, young Pietro?"
    A" S-so you know?"

    " Azzurra quietly shakes her head at me, as if I've said something incredibly stupid."
    "Certainly, that time in  that company of hers has entitled her to such knowledge I am completely ignorant of. "
    "I have nothing resembling initiative in this matter..."
    "What else can I do but listen?"

    F"  Well, why wouldn't I? It's not that arcane,"
    A"Azzurra is standing here before me, questioning me about the divine and the diabolic, rather than stay with her family... not that hard to read, young man."

    F" As for what I can do about that..."

    F"  My rational person wishes to tell you what a big mistake you have made, Anatolio, or even turn you in. "
    show Azu Fredo P0 at center
    F"Yet my emotional person – you can even say the real me – would help you in whatever way I can."
    show Azu Fredo P0 at center
    F" And that I can promise you. If you would only keep what you have seen between us."

    " He steps towards me, and places his hand on my shoulder. He gives me such a stern look: like giving me an order and pleading with me all the same."

    show Azu Fredo P0 at center
    F"  You would agree with me that all of this had better be forgotten."

    " Then he turns to Azzurra."

    show Azu Fredo P0 at center
    F" You've grown to be a clever young lady. You'll understand why in due time; but not now, and not here."

    " Azzurra's lips quiver: wanting to say something, probably."
    "She never does."

    show Azu P50 at center
    Az"  …"

    " Then she looks at me and nods. 'Your turn', is the signal I get. The ball's in my court. I get to call the shot whether I want to or not."
    "Why does this sort of things always happen to me? Whatever am I to do now?"
