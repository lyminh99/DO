    " The more I think, the better an idea it becomes."
    "Father Fredo is Mr. Ines' brother in all but blood. He shall not hurt Azzurra in any situation."
    "Besides, if he really had wanted to do her harm, he's had way too many opportunities over the last half a decade. "
    "So many, that I can't help but shudder thinking about how much harm he could have done if he only wished to."
    "And then there's also his prestige among the clergy, on top of the privileges he is entitled to as part of them. "
    "He can certainly use all that to help us... and I believe he would for all the above reasons."
    "Lastly, if the Church is involved in Azzurra's incident at any rate, Father Fredo is the last person they'd think we would hide Azzurra with. "
    "The safest place is the most dangerous, right? I'm not saying it like the Church is to be our enemy (and I sure hope not!) but that is a possibility I can't discount."
    "Talking about the Church, well, we still haven't handled the Sun Festival business yet. Saving Azzurra doesn't mean she's going to get to attend now."
    "Ah, my foolishness knows no bounds. I should have talked to Father Fredo, in person rather than through Hanes, about all of this."
    "But then I shrug. Late is better than never."
