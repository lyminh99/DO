    nvlDC"At first, I thought finding Azzurra first is a matter of course."
    nvlDC"But then on second thoughts... if Azzurra is truly in this house, she's not going anywhere. Me? I need information, as much as I can lay my hands on. I need to know what has transpired here."
    nvlDC"\n But then, if I'm to turn the place upside down, shouldn't I spend time to do it properly? I have all the time I need, right? Still early, right?    "
    nvlDC"\n That, and I am well and truly curious. The more the Church makes Aurora sound like a coven of demon-worshippers, the more they sound like something really tempting to a young fellow too eager to learn more about stuff like us."
    nvlDC"\n Scary and perhaps sad? Yes. But in the eyes of the younger us there's something about them that beckons us to learn more. The more you keep things forbidden, the more tempted kids are to find it out, that kind of thing."
    nvlDC"\n And now it's my chance. Why not go around, see their lifestyle for what they are, and answer that host of questions for good?"
    nvlDC"\n So I begin traipsing all over the place, opening all the door I can find, turning upside down every chest of drawers and back again, and gawk to my heart's content at all the strange and odd things about me."
    nvlDC"\n In the living room there is a table and a set of chairs, and some tea cups. A thick and respectable bookcase rests against the wall, rivaling Mr. Ines' store, though obviously far less on the musty side."
    nvlDC"\n On a portion of the wall there's a turning knob with all kinds of letters and symbols on it. Ten copper coins that's the control to that safe I want. Let's do that later.    "
    nvlDC"\n In the storeroom there are a bunch of stuff I don't know what to call. I'll go with “piles of wooden and metal things that may or may not be useful.”"
    nvlDC"\n In the kitchen there's a cupboard and cutlery just like every other. There's a door welded shut and can't be opened howsoever."
    nvlDC"\n Along the corridor there are a few picture whose point I can't get. Some were just dots, others just lines, others still looking like a few buckets of paint had been dumped on a canvas and called a day."
    nvlDC"\n The two bedrooms seem even more simplistic: A bed and a dresser each, plus a table at the bedside. The end.
\n 
    "
    nvlDC"\n I decide not to check out the lavatories, for good reasons."
    nvlDC"\n Conclusion: So the real Aurora deal is as human as everyone else. They eat and sleep and read, too, and in their every day life seems dominated neither by sorrow nor baby-sacrificing."
    nvlDC"\n Though strangely I haven't seen Azzurra anywhere during my search. I still have time, though, right? Thinking so, I sit down at the sofa, and rest my sore back."
    nvlDC"\n Then my hand, fidgety as it is, starts running under the mattress..."
    nvlDC"\n … and hit something like a small piece of cardboard.
\n 
    "
    nvlDC"\n I almost jump, but then manage to calm myself."
    nvlDC"\n Whatever shall I do with it now? Should I leave it alone, or check it out?"
    nvlDC"\n As usual, my curiosity wins the duel."
    nvlDC"\n I turn over the mattress."
    nvlDC"\n Now the object isn't a piece of cardboard, but a tiny clipboard, like a toy, with a piece of paper fixed on it.
\n 
    "
    nvlDC"\n “Kirchoff, Mittermacht, friend"
    nvlDC"\n there have been... things, that caused me great alarm. I've taken the liberty to change the safe combination. the old combination can now only open the front chamber. To open both, enter 13U-N1-11-1_-D3.'Brunhide'"
    nvlDC"\n Take care, and let neither Attenborough nor the Duke know"
    nvlDC"\n Sieg Aurora und der Aussenwelt, Schallendorf.”"
    nvlDC"\n Well, well, well. Even Mr. Attenborough doesn't know all things."
    nvlDC"\n Now I know what I should do. I place the clipboard back where it is, then the mattress over it. Then comes the safe's turn.

    A" Brunhilde, right?"

    "Just as expected, I heard a huge click."
    "And then before me a... thing, either strange or miraculous or maybe both, takes place. "
    "A piece of the wall splits up and aside, revealing two compartments: one behind the door, one within it."
    "Inside the former there are some letters and documents that look generic enough. "
    "Inside the latter there is a large file, carefully clipped and stashed away."

    nvlDC"I must have spent some twenty minutes wrangling with that file."
    nvlDC"\n My head has never hurt quite as much."
    nvlDC"\n Is it even possible that someone can stuff so many mathematical formulas (that's what they seem to my eyes) with so many arcane symbols into such a thin collection of paper?
    "
    nvlDC"\n Even the captions seem hard enough to even get. They spoke of a number of names I can't quite recognize: Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen, Schroedinger, Heisenberg, Maxwell... and an experiment concerning a cat who is at the same time both alive and dead."
    nvlDC"\n The part that sounds like the language of people shows that they believe these theories can somehow be applied to this world of ours."
    nvlDC"\n And... that “somehow”... concerns Azzurra? Wait a second.
    "
    nvlDC"\n To recap: They talked lots and lots about such ideas as “closed system”, “quantum overlaps” and “degeneracy” and “energy degeneracy” and whatchamacalit."
    nvlDC"\n But it seems they need Azzurra for an experiment of some sort that involves a close chamber, one of those “Geiger” things for measuring “radioactivity”... and a ton of other things I just have no idea about."
    nvlDC"\n My lack of interest ceases the moment my eyes reach the last paragraph.
\n 
    "
    nvlDC"\n “It is highly unlikely that the test subject would continue existing past the last stage of the test. In any case, whether or not her existence continues, we will be able to draw conclusions accordingly, the pertinence of which has been listed above.”"
    nvlDC"\n It is all I can do not to tear the document to shreds. If I see those who wrote this here, I might as well tear them to shreds, too."
    nvlDC"\n Mr. Attenborough will be wanting to see this. He'll know what he needs to do. As for me, I must take Azzurra out of here, and quick!"
    nvlDC"\n I stand up, close the door behind me, and turn around..."
    nvlDC"\n … to the sound of shuffling slippers.

    C0" Anatolio. I know you'll come."
    
    "I stop dead in my track. Could it be... Azzurra!"
    "I quickly press my ear against the wall."
    
    A"Azzurra! I-is that you?"
    Az"Silly Ana, who else can it be but me?"
    
    "Before I know it, I am back there, in the corridor."
