    " Of COURSE I must find Azzurra first thing first! I can be too silly at times!"
    " So I start my search right away."
    " I run along the corridor, between the storeroom and the living room."

    A"  AZZURRA!"

    " Nobody heard me? That's odd."

    A"  AZZURRA!"

    " I run up the stairway, and into the two bedrooms one after the other."

    A"  AZZURRA!"

    " Nobody, and no answer. Back to the ground floor."

    A"  AZZURRA! I KNOW YOU'RE THERE! ANSWER ME!"

    " My legs carry me to a corner of the corridor. "
    "There, the sun doesn't shine – and yet a patch seems much, much more discolored than the rest..."
    "Wait..."

    A" AZZURRA! YOU'RE THERE, RIGHT? A-ANSWER ME! PLEASE!"

    " I slam my fist against the discolored wall. It doesn't move. I don't think I can even hear anything from inside."
    "But then my instinct tells me for certain Azzurra is there. There is no other logical explanation, right, right?"
    "I calm myself down – with some effort."
    "Alright. So assuming a secret door... there must be a way in, right?"
    "That has to be it, Anatolio, you sly dog, but where? Work your brain, now! Anything that stands out around here? Candlestick? Bookcase? Or even an oddly-placed chair? Anything!"
    "Or is this a rotating door? I try putting my weight against one edge of the patch, then the other."
    "Good guess... except not at all."
    "My face must have turned bright red as sweat streams down my cheek. Who the heck would design a such a senseless secret door like this?"

    C0" Anatolio. I know you'll come."
    
    "I stop dead in my track. Could it be... Azzurra!"
    "I quickly press my ear against the wall."
    
    A"Azzurra! I-is that you?"
    Az"Silly Ana, who else can it be but me?"
    
    "Eh? Are my ears playing tricks on me, or is Azzurra's voice... coming from behind me?"
    "I about-face."
