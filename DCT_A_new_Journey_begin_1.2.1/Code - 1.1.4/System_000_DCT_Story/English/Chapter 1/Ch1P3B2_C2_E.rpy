    A" Fine. I'll go ask Azzurra herself."

    "I still don't think it's a good choice. But then at least I can trust myself to know when Azzurra is lying."

    E" Well, if Ana wishes. But Elena thinks Ana should ask the bookstore owner himself, shouldn't he?"
    A" I don't think that will help matter much."

    "Thank you very much. Unfortunately, fact of the matter is whenever I face good-old-Uncle Ascenderos, my head would threaten to implode upon itself."

    E" Really?"
    "Elena looks a little... down?"
    E" Fair enough. Then Elena should go home, shouldn't she?"

    "Elena waves her hands. In her right hand there is an old piece of paper."

    A" And that is...?"

    E" Doesn't Ana recognize it? Here is Ana's paper!"
    A" Wait, what?"

    "I turn my pockets inside out."
    "No, I'm not mistaken. That is the piece of paper Azzurra gave me just now."
    "When and how did Elena get her mitts on it?"

    E"Ana can come over to Elena's place to claim it. Elena shall be waiting."
    A"No! Give-give it back!"

    "One of the footmen quickly positions himself between me and the culprit before I can react. Then the other... whistled? "
    "Then a carriage appeared out of nowhere. The ground trembles as it rolls. My ears are filled with the sound of the wheel. And the whip. And the horses neighing."
    "Elena climbs into the carriage and stares at me. Her piercing glare chills me to the bone."
