    E" Elena is most pleased."

    "Elena folds her fan with a smirk still on her lips. Then the four of us – footmen and all – leave the park."
    "The sun, by now, has set behind the mountains."

    AS" True. I sold it."

    "So he says, when I have barely mentioned the book name. To be even more certain, he starts looking up his large black ledger. The infamous so-called “Black Book of Ascenderos”."

    E" See, Elena wasn't making it up."
    "Elena approaches with measured steps. She knows how it is going to turn out, it seems."

    AS" That's right. I sold her this book. "

    "As if on reflex, he points at the young lady as she appears. "
    "What about me?"

    A" Is that... so?"

    "That's all I could say."

    AS" Hah. Who would think such a young and well-mannered lady would spend honest-to-the-Creator coins for a book that an old man like me would bore his brain out reading?"
    AS" It's an old book, sure, but if that's what she wants, well that's what she wants. Quite a bargain, she drives. But then... well, that's a lovely lady who asks-"

    "He murmurs, his face turning red as if he's just drowned in half a pipe of rare wine. Whatever he's thinking, I want no part in it."

    "I should be off before his wife comes back."

    AS" Off you go then-"

    E"Did Elena do well this time?"

    "Elena's hair brushes against my shoulder."
    "“You have my full support this time around, Elena,” I raised my thumb. The smile on Elena's lips has yet to fade."
    "So shall it be. Dirty tricks or no, the book is Azzurra's now. "
    "What a way to get between the dilemma's horns. A weight is now lifted from my heart."

    A" But then, Elena... don't spoil Azu like that next time around!"

    "“This is the last time!”, I add."

    E" What if Elena does not agree?"
    "Anatotolio:……………."

    "Yes, I was pretending to be all holier-than-thou. Certainly Elena knows this. Hence her response."

    A" But then... how did you even get to pay for it?"

    "The order of events were definitely messed up. "
    "Elena bought the book while it is still there, but then Azu saw the book fall – this can't have happened after Elena bought it! But then…"

    E"It's a secret!"

    " Girls and secrets. A match made in heaven."
    " I'll just stop now. Let's leave the questioning part to the other blondie waiting at home."

    E" Ana?"

    " Elena has run in front of me, cutting me short."

    E" Want to come over to Elena's place?"
    A" No. Busy."
    E" Doesn't Ana sit around doing nothing every afternoon. Elena knows."
    A" You don't. Unless you've been stalking me."
    A" In any case, I have things to do."
    E" What thing?"
    A" Dinner. Reading. Sleep."
    E" That's fine. Come have dinner with Elena."
    A" I said no, I meant no."

    " To be true to myself, if she had asked me to go somewhere else with her, I would have agreed."
    " Anywhere BUT her mansion. I'm scared off my wits just passing by the place, let alone actually venturing inside."

    E" So... Ana doesn't want this back?"

    "Elena waves about a piece of old paper covered with flowery handwriting."
    "Isn't that face she's making a little... sinister?"
    "Wait a second. I know that piece paper."

    A" Give it back!"

    "When did she take it?"
    "I turn my pockets inside out."
    "No, I'm not mistaken. That is the piece of paper Azzurra gave me just now."
    "If I am to come home without it, well, she'll throw a fit for sure!"

    E" Ana can come over to Elena's place to claim it. Elena shall be waiting."
    A" No! Give-give it back!"

    "One of the footmen quickly positions himself between me and the culprit before I can react. Then the other... whistled?"
    "Then a carriage appeared out of nowhere. The ground trembles as it rolls. My ears are filled with the sound of the wheel. And the whip. And the horses neighing."

    E" So long, dear Ana."
