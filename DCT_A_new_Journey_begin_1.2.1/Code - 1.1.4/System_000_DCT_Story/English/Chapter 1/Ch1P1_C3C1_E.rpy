    " Between the market to the park is more than enough time to come up with the right decision."
    " I'm telling the poor guy."
    " I haven't caused any real consequence worth regretting, and Hanes might be mighty peeved, but that's better than keeping up the act. "
    " Knowing Hanes, if I don't break the charade, well, he's going to buy it until... whenever."

    A" Alright. I admit. I was joking."

    H" Eh?"
    A" I am Anatolio."

    " I sigh as Hanes stares at me like I were the oddest thing."

    H" E-eh? S-so you are-are Ana-Anatolio for real?"
    A" Sorry to disappoint. That's the truth as is."

    H" So it i-is. Ah well. I was a l-little sus-suspicious myself. Thought I've f-found a new f-friend."
    A" Sorry. Shouldn't have done that-"
    A" But hey! It's Olionata, not Otoliana!"

    H" Oh? R-Really? Ha-ha. Looks like I've dis-disappointed you yet again."
    A" That's fine. Either way, it's a made-up name."

    H" R-right. We bre-break it even then?"

    " Hanes snaps his finger. He smiles, revealing his none too regular teeth."

    A" But of course."

    " This is the part where I should feel embarrassed with myself, but then Hanes had alleviated my awkwardness for me."
    " Is it his intention, or just a coincidence? Based on what I know about the guy, the latter sounds much more likely."
    " Not that I'm looking down on him or anything. "
    " Fact of the matter is, while the lot of us are all nearing seventeen, the chance that Hanes – not exactly known for his intuitiveness in the first place – is smarter than myself is close to nil."

    A" So Hanes. How have you been doing?"
    
    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    
    H" Well, well! See, I've be-been helping Father Fredo out, a-all day, everyday!"

    " Hanes extends towards me the necklace bearing the holy Sign of the Creator – that Father Fredo gave him, most likely."

    A" Looks great! But I heard it's quite a piece of work, isn't it?"
    
    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    
    H" It is! B-but it's fun, too. At least I-I've got work to do."

    " Hanes' voice sinks lower. Unhappy memories, perhaps? Well, I'm here to fix that – with a slap on the shoulder."

    A" Hey, hey, hey, can it with the pessimism. Everyone's got their place in life."

    H" You m-might be right."

    " I sit down with Hanes on one of those benches just outside the park."
    " To be honest, I was just encouraging him for the sake of. So far, the poor fellow have proven himself more or less bereft of comparative advantages."
    " Either way, it is unfair, being rejected everywhere simply because of his hair color."

    A" You have us, Hanes. Life's still good."
    
    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    
    H" T-true. Only you and Az-Azzurra still hang around with me."
    A" Hey, don't be a stranger. We're friends."

    " I slap his shoulder again, this time even harder than before. In the hope that he'd feel my strength."
    " In truth, we might be the only living things who can bear to listen to his stuttering."

    A" Alright, care to come over for dinner? My old folks will be overjoyed seeing you as well as you are."
    
    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    
    H" M-maybe later. I have err-errands to run. Father Fredo is waiting."
    A" Back so soon?"

    " Hanes isn't exactly at the apex of happiness right now. I feel like I should do something about it."
    " But then..."

    H" Nah. Work, work, work to do. Apo-apologies."

    " Hanes stands up, both hands tucked in the robe's pockets."

    A" Well then, Azu and I will come along to see you at the cathedral then. Be sure to prepare a treat or two for us!"

    A" Eh? Still a miser like the good old time?"

    " Had he not reminded me, I would have totally forgotten that defining characteristic of my good old friend."

    H" R-right then, I-I'm off."
    A" Well then, I'll be seeing you."

    " Then Hanes turns round and walks away... for a few steps, that is."

    A" What's the matter? Missed me?"

    H" It's my bi-birthday this Sunday. I'm in-inviting you two to the ch-chapel with me. Birthday party."
    A" Wait a second. Is it already your birthday?"
    
    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    
    H" Y-yep. I-it was not all th-that fun last year – you guys weren't t-there."

    H" That, and I-I have something to discuss."
    H" W-well then, I'm off!"

    " Then he turns around. Now he goes away for good."
    " True. Last year Azzurra and I completely forgot his birthday is a thing. Perhaps that's why he bothered to come invite me in person this time."
    " Have I been a terrible friend? Possibly – just a year after he left, I've kinda sorta eliminated him from my personal world."
    " Perhaps that is why I could only look on as he walked – no, staggered – away without a single world uttered."
