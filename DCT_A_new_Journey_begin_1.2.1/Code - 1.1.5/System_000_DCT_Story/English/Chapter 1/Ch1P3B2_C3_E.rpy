    A" Alright. Fine. I'll take your word for it."

    "I let out a long sigh."

    E"That's Elena's good boy."

    " Elena's face brims with confidence. I need not ask: she's certainly done something in the background."
    " I don't like it when one person after another jumps in and facilitates Azzurra's, well, wrongdoings. At all."

    A" I'll let it slide. This time."

	"My brows furrow."

    E" What if Elena keeps on with it next time?"
    A"……………."

    "Again, I'm only putting up a show. Certainly Elena knows it too. Hence, that snappy response. Again."
    "Keep calm, Anatolio. Keep calm. It's for your own good."

    E" Ana!"

    "But then Elena appears to be lost in her own thoughts. Head a little bent, hand on the chin and all."

    E" Want to come over to Elena's place?"
    A" No. I'm busy"
    E" Doesn't Ana sit around doing nothing every afternoon. Elena knows."
    A" You don't. Unless you've been stalking me."

    "Speaking of which... she might be, you know. She might be."

    A" In any case, I have things to do."
    E" What thing?"
    A" Dinner. Reading. Sleep."
    E" That's fine. Come have dinner with Elena."
    A" I said no, I meant no."

    " To be true to myself, if she had asked me to go somewhere else with her, I would have agreed."
    " Anywhere BUT her mansion. I'm scared off my wits just passing by the place, let alone actually venturing inside."

    E" So... Ana doesn't want this back?"

	"Elena waves about a piece of old paper covered with flowery handwriting."
	"Isn't that face she's making a little... sinister?"
	"Wait a second. I know that piece paper."

    A" Give it back!"

    "When did she take it?"
    "I turn my pockets inside out."
    "No, I'm not mistaken. That is the piece of paper Azzurra gave me just now."
    "If I am to come home without it, well, she'll throw a fit for sure!"

    E" Ana can come over to Elena's place to claim it. Elena shall be waiting."
    A" No! Give-give it back!"

	" One of the footmen quickly positions himself between me and the culprit before I can react."
	" Then the other... whistled?"
	" Then a carriage appears out of nowhere. The ground trembles as it rolls. My ears are filled with the sound of the wheel. And the whip. And the horses neighing."

    E" So long, dear lovely Ana."
