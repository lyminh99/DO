    "The thin curtain sways back and forth."
    "It's a holiday. Supposedly, I should have been loitering and lazing around at home."
    "But no, no such luck for poor old Anatolio. In this heat under this sun, I'm right here along with Azzurra. Teaching her stuff. "
    "We don't have a whole lot of time, too: The lesson should conclude before dusk. Should."

    A"  Today we'll be covering Entropy. Done your homework yet? "
    show Azu P47 at center
    Az"  Of course!"

    "Azzurra does a fistbump. Proud of herself, isn't she? So much so, I'm sure she's forgotten why we are here in the first place."
    "As it happened, Azzurra has been too old to attend regular classes from the start. "
    "Not that classes interested her in the first palace: she's made a habit of falling asleep in the middle of lectures of all kinds."
    "Educating her properly, then, falls upon me. Anatolio, the reluctant teacher. His class is in session three noons per week."
    "Making things worse, Azzurra isn't exactly interested in the normal fare. "
    "“Reinventing the wheels is such a waste of time,” she always says as if it were an axiom that needs no further proof."
    "I should have ignored her – but on the contrary, I don't understand why I have to use all my knowledge and talent as a patented bookworm to serve her extraordinary interests."
    "“I must cut to the chase! To discover the secrets of the world!” she declares. Which is to say, Maths, Physics and Chemistry."
    "Of course, there is a clear gap between what she likes to do and what she actually does."

    A"  Then do give me the definition of Entropy."

    "Long story short, it's Physics this day. Class is in session."

    Az"  Child's play! Entropy is a term in thermodynamics!"

    "Azzurra swiftly raises her hand. Filled with confidence, aren't ya?"

    A"  Everybody knows that – it's at the beginning to the chapter! In greater detail please: What is Entropy?"
    show Azu P46 at center
    Az" Entropy is a term in thermodynamics..."
    A" It is! But I said, “in greater detail please”."

    "Azzurra's face sinks. Right. Told you so. She hasn't done her homework."

    show Azu P19 at center
    Az" Yes, yes, yes! I want to study, I really do! To learn more about the world, of course! "
    A"  And why would you? You can live happily ever after without the whole mess. That, and... practically nobody cares about such... ivory-tower stuff these days."

    "True. Books like these are a dying breed. The Church took most of them – to burn or otherwise. The remaining, well, people don't care about them anymore."
    "You know how the market works: It may be good reading, but if it isn't practical no more... it will be eliminated. Slowly, but certainly."
    "In fact, if it weren't for old Mr. Ines, I would have discarded the lot, too. Like every sane person I know."

    "Azzurra lowers her voice, looking away for a brief moment."
    "I know. The hope of one day finding her parents – or any relative for that matter – has never truly been extinguished within her."
    "Well, they did abandon her when she was ten in front of Father Fredo's cathedral. To live or to die, they didn't care. They say that's how she became amnesiac – the shock was just too great."
    
    A"Azzurra… You're still... hopeful about that?"
    
    "All those years. I've asked myself, does there exist a miracle that will bring them back to their daughter?"
    "But that is a story for another time. I tap on the board... and start re-explaining matter all over again. Welcome to my world."

After so many years, old Mr. Ines' house has never quite changed.

\n Looking through the simple window wide ajar one could see a the house's walls whose mortar and paint have long been cracked and broken. Behind them the reddish bricks and bits of green moss are exposed..
    "

\n Somehow that window-sill has an almost irresistible draw to little wild birds. Are they mistaking them for the tree branches of their natural environ? I just know they'd all take off whenever I approach.

\n Peering deeper inside, you can see a curtain at the back of the house, right in front of where I'm sitting. Behind it happens to be the brightest place in the whole house, flooded with sunlight. There we have a wooden table looking remarkably newer than the rest of the furniture around it.

\n It is a pencil sketch upon yellowed paper. Upon it there is the silhouette of a large ranch owner sitting upon a wooden wheelchair. Grabbing his sleeve to his side is a little girl, weak and shy. I wonder, is it because he is too large or she is too small, that he can still rub the back of the girl's head so endearingly even as he's sitting on a wheelchair?

I'm sitting with Azzurra in the living room. Blowing my tea, sipping my tea. It is as if this taste has never faded with time.
\n Until five years ago, I had always come to this place whenever Mr. Ines invited me to. He was the one who introduced me to this bitter drink few people bother with.
    "
    nvlDC"
\n The tavern, as they say, never rests. Grown-ups in our place like to njoy a glass of Classico or Riserva over lunch or dinner. Sometimes they hang out, some other times find a dance mate, some other other times they'd gossip. There, too, are those who simply are there for a break after a long day.

\n “The smell of old wine is like the spice of life, the greatest of all joys and the scent of all of man's hopes and dreams”. So says my father whenever he opens a bottle in the cellar and pour himself a glass.

    "On the contrary, far and away from that thick alcoholic fume, you have that old man, to whom it was that bitter and most extraordinary drink that was the soul of all things.

    A" Gramps, what is this... thing?"

    "The pale green liquid at the tip of the boy's tongue, bitter and terrible, caused him to scream out at once."
    "He was remarkably courageous to begin with, daring to taste this “monster's boogey”, as the kids on the block called it. "
    "Well, it wasn't like he wanted to: they dared him!"
    "In any case, as many adults had given up on this thing, so would he."
    "But he stayed. For what? He didn't know, and he didn't care to know."

    T" This is the fruit of my youth's toils and troubles."

    "The old man pointed to the backyard with an enthusiastic smile on his lips. Ever since he gave up on his ranch, his free time had been mostly devoted to those little leaves. "
    "They called him mad – he did what he liked, without caring what others would think about him. "
    "Madder still, he thought the beverage brewed from those leaves some kind of exquisite drink and advertised them as such."
    "At first people bothered – part out of respect, part out of curiosity."
    "It took the folks mere days – no thanks to some ill-mannered rumors – to name the stuff “pig's urine”."

    A" What about that shrub, gramps?"

    "Old Mr. Ines only smiled. Even though they were long-time neighbors, he had never bothered thinking about the plant's name."

    A" you I grow them just for fun?"

    "The boy hurried over to the small plant just as high as he was tall, bushy and leafy. "
    "The leaves were flat and streamlined, with edges like the teeth of a cogwheel. Out of curiosity, he touched one of them – they were as rough as sandpaper. "
    "The leaf's scent lingered on, on his fingertips."

    A" Ah, that scent! Why is it so much like the leaves of that last time?"

    "The leaves he spoke of, of course, were the yellowed ones he saw in the rubbish bin a few days before."

    T"  But of course. That's the same leaf."
    A"  Urgh… I was drinking.. stuff... made from that... thing?"
    T"  And what is so wrong with that, m'boy?"

    "“Don't touch! They're full of worms.”"
    "Wasn't that what the old man himself told the boy?"

    A"  Oh no. I'm done for."
    T"  Haha… No, I was kidding then. No worms or bugs here. "
    A"  You sure, gramps?"

    "The boy puffed his cheeks, looking at the old man with the most annoyed eyes he could muster. "
    "Perhaps he was truly angry, too, as a few muffled sounds escaped his lips. He folded his legs on the chair, looking away from the old neighbor."

    T"  Well, how does it feel?"
    A"  I'm not sure... It was... sweet?"
    T"  Well, try it again."

    "I was glad to be of service."

    A"  Well, I was joking, gramps. I'm guessing you have a guest?"

    "I stirred the teacup. The wet leaves spun like dancing silk."

    T" What made you think that?"
    A" I need only see the pair of slippers out there!"

    "I made a cold face as if I'd already known."

    T"  Ah, ah, ah. Now here's a smart one. Trying to keep me guessing, eh? That's not good for me blood pressure."
    A"  Nah, gramps. Your health's still awesome! What harm's a bit of high blood pressure going to do?"
    T"  At this age, who knows, m'boy. I could be dead come the morrow."

    "Mr. Ines said with a pessimistic voice. He coughed and spat on his handkerchief. I quickly passed him his teacup. "

    A" That's the most tasteless joke of the day, gramps!"

    "Old Mr. Ines stood still for a second, staring at me with a healthy dose of surprise. Then he broke a smile, tapping on his belly."

    T"  Well, I concur. Point taken."
    A"  By the way, gramps, who's the guest?"

    "Looking at the slipper I guessed it must be a girl. But then I hadn't quite seen her either. Could it be that she was upstairs?"

    T"  Oh yes. She's upstairs. I'll call her down."

    "Told you so. I rarely ever made a wrong guess."

    T"  Oh, and by the way. Doesn't she know you?"
    A"  Know... me?"

    "Mr. Ines turned around just as the wheels had turned full circle. He nodded."

    T" Yep. So I feel. If that's the case, maybe we can spare ourselves the lengthy introduction! Hahaha."
    T" Come down here!"

    "Mr.Ines shouted at the staircase. It had been a while since he could actually climb so easily."
    "Then came the sounds of gentle footsteps on the wooden staircase. "
    "I could hear that footstep from when it was still above me – but it was too small then, for me to have a real feel."
    "I should have gone upstairs to call her rather than Mr. Ines. But then, I felt it would have been rude to do so."

    A"  Huh…"

    "The moment the footsteps upon the wooden planks ceased, that silhouette began to emerge from behind then thin curtain. "
    "The light shining upon it revealed to me each and every feature of a girl my age, petite and possessing long, flowing hair. "
    "I couldn't see her hands, yet the way her tiny feet moved underneath her skirt as she walked revealed all the elegance about her that I needed to know."

    C0" …………………."

    "Were her cheeks burning red, when she finally came out from behind the curtain? Her hair was like a soft golden cloth let free as the curtain brushed upon it, "
    "yet firmly wrapped to the crown of her head. Yes, golden it was and not pale, and far longer than my mother's, "
    "gathered and tied behind her but for a few strands let free, and the mass that hung before her deep indigo eyes. "
    "A pity it was, that the bags underneath her eyes had yet to fully fade, as if a weigh hanging upon her cheeks, "
    "under which rested her strawberry-tinted lips. I didn't know when my spoon fell – only when it clattered on the floor did a startled me start looking at the ground. "
    "There it lay flat, on its handle a wet tea leaf from the cup was stuck."

    C0" Teehee!"

    "She pulled her hand to her lips, hiding an awkward smile. So too did old Ines laugh out loud. He pulled out yet another chair, hidden underneath the table."

    T"  You two, do take a seat "
    C0" Y-yes."

    "Her voice was sweet but terribly low – repressed, perhaps? She was smiling then, but now filled with melancholy. "
    "Staring at the dark shade under her eyes, I could see reddened vessels, much more so than in the eyes of sniveling kids in the neighborhood."
    "She was there, drinking her tea, probably filled with heavy thoughts. That was why I decided I should talk to her. "
    "I might be rude, yes, but at the bottom of my heart I couldn't wait to make friends with such a lovely girl like her."
    "I pulled the tablecloth and gathered it in my hand, wiping my palms, cleansing the bits of dirt on my finger since the morning. "
    "I tried not to let her see me doing so. After readying myself over and over did I extend my hand towards her – embarrassment and all. "
    "My hand, too, shook, as if also taken aback by her appearance."

    A"  I heard you're Mr. Ines' guest?"
    C0" Eh?"

    "She widened her eyes, staring at me. It was as if she hadn't noticed I existed until just now. "
    "She stands up – so suddenly, in fact, that her chair was knocked sideways in one swoop."
    "As usual, I extended my hand towards her and helped her up. Her hands were... callused, "
    "a sharp contrast to her lovely exterior, but that goes perfectly with her simple dress style."

    A" Hello! My name is Anatolio. Nice to meet you!"

    A"Got it. Let's pack up and get ready. I'll go home and get my things."

    Az" Where are we going?"
    "Azzurra asks me, dropping whatever she's arranging on the table."
    A"Go get the water sample, that's what!"

    nvlDC"
I've asked Azzurra to come with me to the river bank at five in the afternoon. The research we are doing is on the composition of the river water.
They say that the Jove, Lucina and Astraea originate from three separate points on the Vitus range. Whether this results in any actual difference between the three rivers' water, that is the question.
    "
    nvlDC"
To be absolutely honest, this wasn't my idea. To be more exact, all of this; all of it, begins from that one time I sneaked into Mr. Ines' room and read his diary.
    "
    nvlDC"
The man was a scholar back in the day. His ideas speak for themselves: he measured the water velocity of the three rivers where they meet Lake Meyr. With a colossal mass of formulae and calculation, he came to the conclusion that the lake cannot take in all that water without forming a whirlpool or three. Thus, the lake has to be much, much larger than it seems. Perhaps even as large as the world itself!
    "
    nvlDC"
This, of course, leads to another corollary: Since all that water can't really evaporate through the bottleneck that is Lake Meyr's surface, this hypothetical underground reservoir has to be connected to the origin of the three rivers according to a law on conservation of water or somesuch. One way, or another.
    "
    nvlDC"
Even more unbelievably, he also drew up a “model” of the world, like so:
    "
    nvl clear
#------------------------------------------------

#CG: mô hình thế giới.


    "According to this model, the three continents as we know it act as three massive corks that covers most of the underground Lake Meyr. "
    "The weight of the landmass, in turn, forces the water from the underground lake back to the top of the Vitus range... where they flow back down all over again. "
    "This model, he coined it, “the fish's tank”. It makes a little sense, but not much. But it's the best shot we have."
    "If his reasoning is correct, the water within the three rivers will be identical, and absolutely the same as the lake's water. "
    "It's only a necessary condition for the mass of formulae right after, but being a necessary condition, if it is not true, then we can write off all of them formulae as bogus. "
    "I wanted to skip this step, but then Azzurra was adamant we do it first."

    A"  Of course I do! Mr. Ines might have been stumped, but to me, this is child's play!"
    A"  Sure, we can't go into the water... but we can send an 'agent' to do our bidding."
    A"  Here's the plan: I'll toss a ball of wax containing a pouch of poison hemlock into the river. "
    A" After a few hours the wax will melt, and if everyone drinking from the three rivers are poisoned, "
    A" then it's obvious the three rivers are linked. Mission accomplished, time to move on to the next."
