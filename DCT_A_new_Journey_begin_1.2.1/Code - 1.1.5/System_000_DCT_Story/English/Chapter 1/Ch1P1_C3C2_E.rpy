    " Screw it. The deed's already done. Let no deception come to waste: I'm rather curious what he thinks about me."
    " I can spill the bean much, much later when he leaves. But until then, what prank should I play on him, hmm?"

    A" Hanes. Do you live near here?"

    H" N-no. I am l-living in the ch-chapel."
    A" The cathedral? Ah, so you're a priest?"

    " Playing a fool: not a bad way to ask him how he's been doing over the last two years or so."

    H" T-that's what I want, b-but for now I'm a mere aco-acolyte."

    " Hanes scratches his head, his voice raised as if embarrassed."

    A" An acolyte, is it? Must be tiring work. How long have you been there?"
    
    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    
    H" F-for about a year now."
    A" Right. "

    H" T-tired it is. B-but it's fun, too. "
    
    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    
    H" At least I-I've got work to do. "

    " As Hanes suggests, the two of us took a seat on one of those benches outside the park. Then.."
    " … he started emptying his heart."

    H" Otonali-lia, y-you know, I'm... not exactly wel-welcomed. Most of the t-time."
    A" Even among your friends? "
    
    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    
    H" My fr-friends?"

    A" Like Anatolio."

    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    
    H" Oh. Ana-Anatolio, you mean? He is one of the only tw-two friends I've g-got. H-how'd you kn-know?"
    A" You've just mentioned him like a few minutes before."

    " So, Hanes, how does it feel, forgetting I exist? Tell you what, a prank's on the way with your name on it."

    show Azu Hanes P2 at center
    
    H" Oh. R-right."

    " Hanes furrows his brows for a moment or so. Thinking something. Something incredibly deep and profound, perhaps? Or maybe just something ridiculous?"

    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    
    H" T-true. I have two fr-friends. Ana-Anatolio is one of t-them. He's a br-brother to me."

    " A brother, is it? Keep that in mind till the end of your life, will you?"

    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    
    H" T-the second is Azz-Azzurra. A re-really nice girl, too."

    " Well... I won't be taking your words for it on this matter."

    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    
    H" How about you, Otoli-liana? D-don't you have man-many friends?"

    " Then Hanes stares at me – catching me by surprise. What am I supposed to say now?"

    A" Eh? Me? Well... uh... matter is, my family travels around a lot. Like... a whole lot. Not good for making friends, no."
    
    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    
    H" Oh, is that so? W-we are on the same b-boat then."
    A" R-right! The same boat, yeah!"
    
    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    
    H" A-as it happens, my job k-keeps me in the ch-chapel Can't find the t-time to meet up with those t-two."

    " Hanes stands up, looking up at the clouds floating about the red dusk."

    A" You can go visit them at their place, you know."

    H" I cannot."
    A" Why?"

    H" ..."

    " Hanes straightens up his acolyte robe. The sunset behind him looks as if it is granting him a saintly halo, cloaking him in its glory."
    " There he stands, dusting his hair, widening his normally half-closed eyes. He looks at me like a true saint preaching before the pious mass."

    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    
    H" B-because I'm l-lazy. Just like t-that."

    H" I'm afr-afraid. I have a lot of w-work to do."

    " Then he extends his hands towards me."

    H" G-glad to get to know you, Otoliano."

    " Wait a second. Did my made-up name sound so... feminine in the first place? What is it in the first place, anyway? I've forgotten."
    " Was it Otoliano? Or Otoliana? Or Atalionto? I do remember having put the 'o' at the front, but everything following that is now beyond me."
    " Ah, never mind that."

    A" Certainly. The pleasure's all mine."

    " I answer, calmly and politely. Hanes' memory isn't especially remarkable. He isn't going to remember anything about this mess."

    " Wait. How can I go with Anatolio when I am Anatolio?"
    " Fact of the matter is, I've missed Hanes' birthday last year."
    " While I've always think myself to be nothing but a good friend, it took me but a year out of sight to forget Hanes exists. Not even a visit paid, even."
    " And this year, well, he has to come along to urge me to his party. I'm a horrible person, ain't I?"
    " But that's not the worst thing, no. The worst part is that... I've forgotten to tell him the truth at the end of the day."

    A" Ah, screw it. What's done's done.…"

    " Maybe I'll make a confession later. Now? Time to go to the park."
    " I need a nap. Or two. Or three."
