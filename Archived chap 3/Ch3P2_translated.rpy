    nvlDC"We set our foot upon the cemetery's cobblestone pavings just as the morning crosses into the afternoon."
    nvlDC"\n Azzurra looks rather spent. To be honest, so am I. But then I am a gentleman, and behaves as a gentleman should – as in, helping her off the carriage."
    nvlDC"\n By the way, Azzurra was right. The carriage today is just a tad slower than it normally is."
    nvlDC"\n Or, to be more precise, it is still technically the early afternoon, yet thanks to some sort of divinely-ordained arrangement, there was not a single ray of burning sunlight. "
    nvlDC"\n There is only that kind of gentle, caressing radiance, blanketing over every blade of grass – a color of yellow so very light, dotted with specks of green."
    nvlDC"\n Before us stands the tallest among the Vitus range. Invicta is the name, and accordingly majestic is its stature."
    nvlDC"\n Up there, atop the highest summit, arches a great rainbow, like a gigantic drawbridge into the realm of the Creator, framed by a curtain of thin fog and the twinkle of water reflecting sunlight."
    nvlDC"\n It only comes to an abrupt stop as it meets the great wall of stone that is the Vitus itself: tall, majestic, impenetrable."
    nvlDC"\n You need only take a couple hours in that particular direction, and the snow flower's aroma would become so apparent."
    nvlDC"\n Leaving Azzurra kneeling before Mr. Ines' gravestone whispering to the man six feet under, Dad takes the rest of us up the hill. "
    nvlDC"\n It is, after all, a beautiful day and an opportunity to see the horizon for what it is."
    nvlDC"\n As we moves deeper into the cemetery, the graves become more and more disorderly. "
    nvlDC"\n So many gravestones besieged by shriveled weed, dotting the landscape as far as the eyes can see. A certain feeling of desolation thus invades us, in spite of the clear sky."
    nvlDC"\n The weed has grown long, shriveling and huddled together into tangled clumps, like an army of besieging the tombstones that never stood a chance. "
    nvlDC"\n They'd brush up against our legs with every step, and sparing no chance to attach themselves to our clothes."
    nvlDC"\n To give credit where credit is due, weed IS known for its persistence."
    nvlDC"\n How Dad can brave the field without troubled in the least by this field of annoying grass might well be a mystery for the ages."
    nvlDC"\n Me? It is just as you've guessed: suffice to say this has turned into something of an obstacle course."
    nvlDC"\n I would have been better off just following Hanes' example and keeping Azzurra company, for real."
    nvlDC"\n Dad halts at the broken-down wall, pointing at the double rainbow above our head. Today they look akin to the spread wings of a great bird rather than an arc like it usually is."

    P" There's one rainbow, lad. Must have rained."
    "Now isn't that odd... Unless..."
    A" ..."
    "Took me a while, but finally I shake my head."
    A" I doubt it's a rainbow though."
    "Next thing I know, Dad's large palm has connected with my back with a loud and rather painful – to me – slap. "
    "It is just like him, I think to myself, to make use of his larger size against me."

    P" Weather's been acting up, that it does. You wouldn't expect a single drop of rain this time twenty years ago."
    A" Well, that's, you know, maybe perhaps it hasn't rained at all. That's no rainbow."
    show Azu OngPietro at center
    P" Why, my dear young scholar worthy of the Ivory Tower, what would that be? "
    P" Perhaps you would be so kind as to shed just a tiny bit of light on this unenlightened caravaneer, would you?"
    "Dad's voice drips with disdain. I don't like being disparaged. Therefore it has to go."

    A" Well, if you say so, Dad, I'll give you one. That's a fire rainbow. Pretty sure those in the know call it a circumhorizontal arc."
    A" That's a sort of halo spectrum, see, similar to the ordinary rainbow, but not exactly so. "
    A" You get a rainbow from light refracting along tiny water particles after a heavy rain or so, but this fire rainbow you get it from sunlight passing through ice crystals formed in those clouds very very high up there. "
    A" So they don't actually have a clear shape or form, unlike a rainbow. And unlike a rainbow, it has nothing to do with the weather being sunny or rainy or whatever."
    A" The more you know!"
    show Azu OngPietro at center
    P" So the kind of rainbows we normally see is a water rainbow?"
    "Dad sniffs. Which means he's trying to come up with a way to wing the argument his way."
    "Am I going to let it be? Hell to the nope."
    A" Nope. Water, fire, neither's relevant. That's just a name. Figure of speech."

    A" Not in principle, no. But they're still distinct!"
    show Azu OngPietro at center
    P" Well that means it's getting colder. Am I right, lad?"
    A" You can say that, Dad."
    "Now Dad no longer makes a sweeping generalization as he has just now. He's finally learnt to be more watchful with his unscientific declarations around me, I think."
    "By “Am I right”, and by patting me on the shoulder so lightly rather than slamming me on the back as before, perhaps he's admitting defeat. "
    "“Well, lad, now aren't you something?” is what he'd maybe say. I'm not sure how sincere his sentiments are, but real or not, the thought fills me with elation."
    "Then Hanes' shouting brings us back to Azu's place."
    "This time around, Dad no longer wades into the bush. Instead he finds for himself a path off the trail to the left of the main burial ground. Wait, does such a path exist?"
    "My rejoice vanishes. The atmosphere condenses all about me."
    "Now Azzurra places her bouquet at the foot of the grave, and then stands up. I think she wants to say a bit more – whatever it is on her mind – but then for whatever reason has decided against it."
    "Azzurra's cloth soles are now smeared with so much mud."

    "There's also another matter that once every so often nags at me – that this entire business has been a mistake and I should head home at once."
    "That being Mom."
    "She's handling the household in her lonesome right about now. To her credit that's kind of what she does – it's a matter of course being the wife of a caravaneer and all. But she is getting older and it shows."
    "Mom's also troubled with repeated bouts of minor illnesses of late. I'm not sure if she'd do well alone. That thought's like a spanner in the cogs of whatever machination I have in mind."

    "Now the second De'Rovere bridge never seems to be as crowded as it should be. The Grand Cathedral and the Hallowed Fold lies on the other side, neither the place for the mass except on feast days, which today isn't."
    "But something IS out of the ordinary."

    C0"  Stop right there, citizen."

    "Bright mail. Imposing pauldrons. Tall helmets. And that tabard,"
    "That I should get into trouble with the Templars twice in a month. "
    "Templars, as in plural: There they stand, barricading the other end of the bridge with a checkpoint and literally their own imposing form like immovable towers of strength, bearing their great long arming swords fashioned in the likeness of the symbol of the merciful Faith – though there is nothing remotely merciful in taking lives with them."
    "I've never been a big fan of their fashion sense, though they never seem to mind how much they stand out like a sore thumb in civilian life."

    NHG": Well, no wonder you aren't aware. Unfortunate happenings, that's the deal while you weren't in the City. It's regretful, but the ordinary citizens – you specifically – aren't to cross the bridges upon pain of death."
    "Wait, what?"
    "I've only been away for a month! What happenings? What troubles? What in the name of all that's holy has happened?"
    NHG": You'll excuse me, citizen. Church business. Father Fredo could tell you more."
    A" Well, then you can let us see him, right?"

    "Now he walks towards us, his feet thumping on the carpet like so many bricks. He towers above us, and like so many times before the question of why this man ended up being a priest again rings out in my inquisitive head."

    F" It might be a little hard on you, but believe me when I say a picture is worth a thousand empty words, and actual experience is worth a million ornate paintings."
    "Then he tells us his explanation of the unfortunate happenstances this morning."
    "Hanes rolls his eyes. Azu gasps. And I? Well, I don't have too many words except for..."

    A" So... you know everything? Us being locked out, and Hanes being chased across the street? And you didn't let us know?"
    F" Yes, and no. and in the name of the Creator I would apologize. Forgive me."
    "Hanes and I both run forward, and helped the priest to his feet. Took but a blink of an eye before Azzurra joins us, too."
    "His age now seems to have taken its toll: Father Fredo's back slumps, and it is all the lot of us could do to walk him back to the nearest bench"

    H" Your back isn't s-so good any more, Father. Have you forgotten?	Hanes' complaint was caring and dutiful at the same time. I would question where has this version of Hanes come from, but then I've got too many things I'd like to ask instead."
    A" But Father, I don't get it. What's with the bridges being locked down? What about Hanes and the angry mob? And why is everyone acting up?"
    "Father Fredo looks at us with downcast eyes. Maybe it is just me, but I can swear his breathing sounds ragged and uneven. His wrinkles seems to be etched deeper into his skin, not helped by the black spots under his eyes."
    "He clicks his tongue."

    F" Let's go back to a month ago."
    F" There was a major... attack. A robbery, you may say, of a scale hardly seen before, against a caravan from the Nobles' Quarter.."
    A" Really, Father?"
    "I have no idea, and no, I'm not joking. Nobody told me about that, and last time I checked last month I wasn't even in the City. Perhaps a weird feeling of deja vu is all I get from it."

    F" Now the merchant folks were badly shaken. Several were badly hurt. "

    F" You don't have such vicious attacks on merchant caravans every day, thank the Creator. So when this monstrous rabble of brigands disappeared back into the Common Quarters..."

    H" M-monstrous rabble?"

    show Azu Fredo P3 at center
    F" Right you are, Hanes. That's how the witnesses described them: like a hungry band of jackals tearing up their prey, that's how bad it was. And so naturally they have to have been based somewhere in the Common Quarters."

    F" It goes without saying that you'll always have division and friction between the haves and the have-nots. This sort of incident would have been nothing worth commenting on, in more chaotic times, but we are now a society more peaceful than ever before."

    show Azu Fredo P3 at center
    F" It is all thanks to the Church's intervention that the panic died down. The Archbishop, well, took the bull by the horn on behalf of the poor in the Common Quarters. "
    F" We've done quite a bit of talking to the Council on both sides of the Astraea. We'll do the investigating, we promised them, and punish the culprit in accordance with laws and customs."
    F" On one condition that everyone could agree on..."
    
    "Father Fredo clicked his tongue as if habitual."
    F" We agreed to keep the bridges close until we can find the truth. Or failing that, reach some sort of a mutually acceptable resolution for all parties concerned."
    A" But that's senseless!"
    F" That it is. But you have to look at it this way, Anatolio. The men of the cloth are as frightened of thieves in the night as any man of not insignificant wealth. Extreme measures as this becomes sensible under such light."
    F" Funny, when you think of it: the safekeepers of the wealth of the world so it could be used for the good of the flock, frightened stiff that the flock would take it away from them."
    "Father Fredo's chuckle seems more bitter than usual. That's quite like him... and unlike him at the same time."
    F" But wait, that's not the end of the story. By the Creator's infinite mercy, it gets worse."
    F" Hanes, Anatolio, Azzurra. I ask that you stay calm, and hear me out"
    F" Hard as it sounds, we are all in this, even myself, by guilt of association."
    "The old priest's face suddenly becomes like stone."
    "Over the next few minutes, so do ours."

    TGM": It has been two decades since we have seen such sin soiling the sanctity of the City. And as the only sin of such ilk it is therefore the gravest."
    TGM": Father Massimiliano Fredo, for years now the people in the Three Quarters of the City look to you as a beacon of faith. The time is come, to act in accordance with to the trust that the Creator and His flock has vested in you."
    "The second most senior Church official, only answerable to the Pope Himself. Middle-aged and possessing of a stately appearance himself, he could be quite charismatic when he wanted, and rather fearsome when he'd like."
    "Hardly becoming of him, one would think, to try to intimidate his way through Father Fredo."
    "Unfortunately for him, his adversary happened to be the Massimiliano Fredo. Father Fredo was definitely not on his home field, yet in his tumultuous life he had rarely been. His eyes flared, and the Archbishop's form betrays a shiver."
    "Massimiliano had once been something. He had never ceased being something."

    F" I find such resolution unfeasible and unsatisfactory."
    F" We are talking about keeping a very large part of the Creator's own flock in no small discomfort and inconvenience, almost akin to house arrest, because of the crime committed by a tiny, insignificant, unrepresentative few."
    F" By the boundless mercy of the Creator, it is bad enough that we keep a closer leash on the people coming and going."
    "Now the Archbishop regained his mettle. He walked towards the pulpit, and looks down at Father Fredo under his goggles."
    TGM" Unrepresentative. So you say, Father. Is this lack of representativeness... provable? Can you prove it so?"
    "Probatio diabolica. Pretty much a logical fallacy under both laws and customs and frowned upon at court."
    "But then again, the Archbishop has never held much stake in such secular inconveniences as 'proof' or 'logic' if they ran contrary to his reasoning."
    F" The burden of proof is on you, my young man. Faulty generalization notwithstanding."
    "The rest of the Council looks on, perhaps amused, perhaps anxious. An extraordinary meeting had just become more so: Now it had become a proving ground between the most prominent Church official and the most prestigious."
    "And the Archbishop's lips curled into a triumphant smirk."
    TGM" That it is, ser Fredo. The burden of proof is on me, and I can satisfy it."
    "The word ser dripped with sarcasm. So did the finger pointed at the old priest's face, so devoid of respect."
    MS" We've got a report coming in this afternoon. The Foremost Templar confirmed that, against all laws and customs most holy, a group of ne'er-do-wells have committed grand theft upon the sacred water of the Astraea. Surprising, isn't it? Incredible, and insane! Stealing the water itself! We asked, too, who that would be..."
    "That was one of the younger priests just promoted into a bishop standing under the pulpit. He was much, much younger than Fredo, and somehow reminded him of the younger days of his: so fervent and yet so... unreasonable."
    F" Stealing the water of the Astraea? Nonsense!"
    "That was hardly becoming of him, Father Fredo now realized. But the logic remains irrefutable."
    F" The water belongs to everyone! If you'd said someone poisoned the water, or dammed the river, or otherwise make it so the public cannot use it? I'd buy that. But stealing water from the river? That's preposterous beyond words!"
    "The young bishop smirks"
    MS" That would have been the case, Father. From the beginning, we have had our doubt. Sounds, exactly like you said, nonsense. I thought it was a metaphor of sort, for a kind of technology for pumping the water."
    MS" We are right. It is, indeed, a pump and pipeline. Not exactly forbidden technology, and we'd have welcomed such innovations had it not been for a certain... something—"
    "He raises his voice.."
    MS" We found out something interesting in the process."
    MS" Imagine this: Three children, working with a group of workers, building a system of pump and pipelines from the river to an outlying village. In service of the people, using the gift of the mind as the Creator has blessed them with."
    F" You said it: A blessing."
    MS" A blessing? Perhaps. It would be, ser, had it not been for the inherent thievery involved in this act."
    "Father Fredo's face became like stone. He let out a quick breath: What was he hearing, and why did it sound so much like nonsense?"
    MS" Now you'd ask, how that came to be. And here's how: Everything they did, the technique, the material, even the workers, were taken without leave from the possession of the nobility in the upper half of the City!"
    "He stares at Fredo with his needly stare: like two prongs of a spiny trap."
    MS" Now imagine this, happening just three days after that great robbery? Would you, were you a member of the honorable upper class, not think there is some kind of connection here?"
    "Father Fredo said nothing... until the archbishop, probably getting impatient, harrumphed loudly."
    TGM" That's the situation, ser Fredo. Two incidents of theft and robberies in succession. One by the unruly adults, one by the unruly children."
    TGM" Now you can say when a child does wrong, their parents are likely to be sinners. When many children do wrong, the fault is probably with the community. Not entirely nonsense, no?"
    TGM" So, what says ser Fredo? That would be a fine proof, am I not right?"
    "Now the conversation had stopped being formal, just as the night breeze had ceased. The room had become correspondingly stuffy, as if the sky itself was seeking to crush everyone with the sheer weight of the moon and the stars."
    F" That is utterly ridiculous, and you know it."
    F" You understand you are accusing a group of kids only to serve your petty generalization. You know what this means to them? To their future? Don't you?"
    F" I demand a more thorough investigation, by whatever means necessary, before we should arrive at such a ruling!"
    "It was the first time in decades that Father Fredo's blood boils as much as it did. His enthusiasm had never truly died. It had just withdrawn to a lesser-known part of himself, like a frozen volcano underneath a glacier.  "
    "When the ice cap would melt and the ground should crack, it would erupt again, in all its terrible, frightening heat and flame."
    "Yet the Archbishop looked completely and unduly unfazed."
    TGM" But of course, as men of the cloth, we understand that – more than anyone else."
    TGM" It is just that we are as much keepers of the peace as we are keepers of the scriptures, and have to give rationality its due."
    TGM" That is why – that is why we have to find some sort of middle ground. A less inflammatory excuse, if you will. We aren't closing the bridge to bully some kids who may or may not know what they're getting into. We are doing so to keep the peace and ensure due justice is served."
    TGM" The people demands some sort of action, and we give shall them that. Nobody needs to know anything more than they need to. Unless, of course, you would prefer to let the truth out, and let the faithful deal with these children as they would have been under more troubled times."
    F" This is blackmail and you know it!"
    TGM" Not blackmail, Father Fredo, just a difficult choice for a difficult problem. You were no stranger to such dilemmas yourself, weren't you?"
    "Father Fredo's tongue clicks entirely out of self-preservation – lest his angry jaws gnash upon it like a heretic about to be ritually crushed by a thousand hammers. Or perhaps, just perhaps, the glare of several dozen men, all Graced, has frightened it into submission."
    F" Very well. Very well then."
    "His argument, Father Fredo bitterly realized, no longer held. Silently whispering an apology to the Creator, he admitted defeat – that a Templar would never do unless all options have been well exhausted."
    "Everyone else remained silent – except the Archbishop."
    TGM" Which is as it should be, Father Fredo. Your decision is much welcomed – as a good shepherd and a good man."
    TGM" I suppose that is decided: we shall maintain the blockade until further notice. So it has been decided, and so shall it be."
    TGM" As for you: your virtuous service of the Creator and your fellow men are as always much appreciated, and you need not bother yourself with such matter as these."
    nvlDC"\n Father Fredo said nothing. He was no stranger, after all, to the cloaking of rotten politics in virtuous moralizing."
    nvlDC"\n He was being feared – as someone who has the influence and power vested unto him by his piety and prestige rather than by any Church decree. And those who are feared by their higher moral ground, well, tend to be brought down by the group effort of men lesser and of less righteousness both."
    nvlDC"\n It had been the case with the closure of the De'Rovere bridge. At some point there might have been a good excuse to do so– back in those days where the world was in turmoil and the Church itself was in peril. "
    nvlDC"\n But today, well, everyone with half a brain would know there were golden candelabras and gaudy stained glass panels in it for those who'd made the decisions."
    nvlDC"\n “What good can an old man do?” Father Fredo is not unfettered by thoughts as such. Once every so often he'd find arising within him a desire to resign from all spiritual duties, and return to being Massimiliano the old man in his last days – un-Graced, unweighted, unfettered."
    nvlDC"\n At some point it was appealing to find a place less traveled, perhaps deep in the Inner Forest or further still from civilization, and record the thoughts gleaned through so many years of his life for all posterity. But then, he had long decided against it."
    nvlDC"\n He stayed because he was needed – because there were lost souls in need of saving. If he couldn't change things for the better, he could at the very least make sure things didn't change for the worse. To keep the peace, while waiting for his own reckoning – that wouldn't be too far off."
    nvlDC"\n Perhaps one of those days the Creator would finally find it within his infinite benevolence to redeem them. He would again walk among men, and in his omnipotence bring the light of dawn upon the mass. "
    nvlDC"\n Father Fredo might be as stubborn as the likes of Hanes say, or as close-minded as Anatolio argues. That he did not mind: if the faith imperishable in the Creator does not preserve him in his trying hours, then nothing would."
    
    nvl clear
    TGM" As an aside..."
    "The Archbishop passed by him, and into his ears whispered:"
    TGM" Is it not what you have said yourself?"
    TGM" A world that seems too good to be true might as well be too good to be true."
