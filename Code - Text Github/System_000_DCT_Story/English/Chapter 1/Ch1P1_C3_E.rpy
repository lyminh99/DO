    " The afternoon market is nearing an end. The sound of brooms fill the main street. "
    " Some lost chickens, having breached their cages, now run to the main street and begin crowing."
    " Hey, hey, hey! Stop pestering me. I've got nothing. Hey! You hear me, you little... rooster?"

    C0" Anatolio!! Oi oi…Anatolio…"

    " Seems like it isn't just the chickens. Someone, too, is pestering me."

    A" Hey, hey! I don't know you, do I?"

    " That's okay, in any case. It's not that big of a bother."

    C0" What do you m-mean you don't kn-know me? It's-a me, Hanes! A-aren't you Ana-Anatolio?"
    A" Nope and nope. I'm Olionata. Anatolio's semi-half-step-cousin. Aren't you Hanes?"

    H" Eh? I-is it? Y-you do look like Ana-Anatolio, don't you?"
    A" Do I? You know, you do  look like my old friend Henas. Like twins, you are."

    H" E-eh? But-"
    A" Let's make it this way: If I were Anatolio, then you'd be Henas."
    A" And if I am Olionata, you are Hanes. Nice and easy."

    H"  Good meeting a-a brother of his here, by the C-Creator! Hanes' my n-name, nice to meet y-you. "

    H" Y-you do take after Anat-Anatolio much, don't y-you?"
    A" That's good to know. Everyone tells me that."

    " Well that's because I'm Anatolio."

    A" Oh. You do look like an extraordinary sort. Would be good to be friends, yes?"

    " Extraordinary, as in nobody buys what I've just said but you. Right, back to the issue."
    " That rather-comely-fellow-just-behind-me in his turtle-collared robe who just caught me bullied by them chickens is an old friend back from the day we were toddlers throwing stuff at each other. "
    " We call him Hanes – there is also the fact that the couple that raised him never bothered giving him their surname. "
    " Until today, we still refer to Hanes by his given name, both friends and strangers alike."

    H" T-that's good, Oli-lionata."

    " He takes my hand with as much joy as if he had just made a real  new friend. Misreading 'my' name, too, because stutters."
    " Yet that is not where my impression of Hanes ends. A much more impressive characteristic of this good fellow is his hair, white as platinum and his pink-red irises. "
    " Now that's some rare fares, right there. White, just like his mind: ironically pure like his own naivete. "
    " On the other hand, that specialness did cause Hanes no end of problems. Everyone thought he looked... odd. "
    " Without Father Fredo's help, he'd be more or less like me: a slacker. Except his family isn't quite as well off as mine, so to speak."
    " I guess I personally owe Father Fredo a thanks. Ever since Hanes became an acolyte, he has had a place to call his own."
    " Speaking of which, it has been a long while since I last spoke to him."
    " Does it not sound right that the first meeting after such a long while I've taken to play a prank on him?"

    " What should I do?"
