    P" Nope, not a clue!"
    "I found Dad where he usually is, sitting in his bench reading all sorts of things after dinner."
    "Now his fingers drum against the handrest. He looks... irritated somehow."
    A" … was that something I said, Dad? Isn't like this is something to hide, right?"

    P" I said not a clue. Even if I did, wouldn't be a good idea to say."
    "“I dare you to try” is what his smirk says as he looks in our general direction. Strangely, Mom isn't so quick to jump to my defense as she usually does this one time."
    "So there you have it. I've done what I can, It's not that easy to suppress the headache that this festival and the magic number ten have roused in me."
    "I thought of Hanes before, but then would he necessarily know more than I do? I want an answer from an eyewitness rather than hearsays. Dad seemed a perfect choice at the time."

    P" Let me remind you, young man, not to be distracted! Bed, bed it is! You've got work tomorrow – don't let Mr. Ascenderos give you the sack!"
    "And with that Azzurra was politely shoved to the curb."
    "Well, I'll put that down to Anatolio Pietro putting his faith in the wrong person. Dad is simply not listening."
    "Though, to be honest, when I look at Mom and her being not exactly comfortable with the business, it does seem like they are hiding something from me, and are thoroughly unwilling to let it go."

    A" Fine, fine, fine. I'll go ask Hanes when I can then."
    "What a way to waste a day."
    A" On a side note—"
    "All I can do is right now go for a defiant last laugh."
    A" I hardly think I'd ever get fired, Dad."

    "“Honey, is that really what we should do?”"
    "“Well, what do we do then? It isn't like we should tell him. Unhappy stuff. I know the sort.”"
    "“Unhappy or not he will find out sooner or later. If we let him know early, perhaps—”"
    "“Well then, let him go figure it out himself. The Creator has endowed him with a destiny of his own and the brains to see it done.”"
