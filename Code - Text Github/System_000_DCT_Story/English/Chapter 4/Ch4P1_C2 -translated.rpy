    "Let's be honest: that number ten has been clinging to my head and would not let go. And I need someone who knows and is willing to shed some light on the coincidence."
    "Hanes would perhaps be the most accessible source of information I have in mind at the moment. Being an initiate and a Graced no less, he should know more about how to run this festival than most of the random people I can ask, or even my parents."
    "There's only the slight problem that he's as busy as ten men, and it would be neither classy nor courteous disturbing him right about now. So..."
    A" Let's just continue walking around."

    Az"  That's boring!"
    "Not so fast, Azu. That's why I have to find another way."
    A" Not exactly so if you help me keep an eye out on people who look trustworthy?"

    show Azu P42 at center
    Az" Wait, what? Why must I do that?"
    A" I'll tell you later, 'kay?"
    show Azu P53 at center
    Az" I'm not doing anything until you tell me why!"
    A" Please, Azu, can't you trust me for once?"
    show Azu P49 at center
    Az" No means no!"

    "Azzurra steels her face and makes a point not to answer."
    "What choice do I have but tell the truth?"
    A" Okay, fine, you win, happy?"
    A" Let's find someone trustworthy so I can just maybe ask them about this Sun Festival."

    show Azu P58 at center
    Az" Eh?"
    A" This festival business... don't you find it terribly fishy? I'll tell you more later on exactly how terribly fishy I think it is, but we need all the facts before that."
    A" So, how about you find someone who looks like they have five minutes to spare and wouldn't lie to a pair of wide-eyed, inquisitive and probably relevant twenty-year-old?"
    A" People older than us should have attended this festival thing at least once, shouldn't they?"

    Az" Hừm…"

    Az" Alright. Sincere as you are, I'll lend you my incredibly sharp eyes and even sharper tongue for this business."
    "Well, that's both overconfident and sappy at the same time..."

    Az" But wait, how about Hanes?"
    A" My first thought exactly. Problem being he's locked on the other side of the bridge. You know how that happened."

    show Azu P42 at center
    Az" That's not what I mean – do you think Hanes is trustworthy?"
    A" Of course he is. If he were here, things would be much clearer. The only problem is—"
    C0" H-Hullo! Did someone say my name?"
