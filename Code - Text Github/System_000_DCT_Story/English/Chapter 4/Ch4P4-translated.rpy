    "Exhausted. Beleaguered. And most of all, despairing."
    "Everything seems a vast emptiness to me, Azzurra's name echoing in my head – with all the regret and a jumbled mess of emotions that brings."
    "Rain streams down my face. My hands freeze. The thought that Azzurra is out there somewhere under the same rain chills me to the bone."
    "True to the wise words, company would defeat the most terrible of winter, while desolation would bring endless frost even to the warmest of summer."
    A" Azzurra."
    "I've been murmuring her name like a mantra of madness, as if it would lift the fatigue off my feet."
    "The air around me congeals; it is as if I were swimming in melted snow."
    "And the ground feels to my feet like an endless swampland whose mud and dirt would stick to my sole with every passing step, deigning to swallow me whole into its depths."
    "For once that doesn't seem so bad..."
    "Snap out of it! No time for negativity! Creator's mercy, please deliver Azzurra to safety!"

    "A flash of lightning ignites in the sky, accompanied by a terrible thunderclap, like a predator's monstrous roar. My ears goes numb, my eyes blurred by its aftereffect."
    "Where was I again? On the way to the lake. That's where I would meet Hanes. If he's luckier than I, this would be my last chance to find Azzurra tonight."
    "And of course he would be, I told myself. Hanes has the support of the entire Church and Father Fredo and whatever else,"
    "What I find instead is a Hanes waiting for me in the rain. His mass of white hair and crooked figure stands like a twig planted in the ground before my eyes."

    H" Anatolio-"
    "He speaks as calmly as he has ever been. More calmly, in fact, than the situation would have warranted."
    "Good old Hanes, still in the dusty initiate robe of his, stands there in the rain, drenched to the bone. He must have been waiting for me for a while now."
    "His sorry state of affairs is, unfortunately, the least of my concerns right now."
    A" W-where's A-Azzurra?"
    "But then Hanes shrugs."
    H" O-of course she isn't here."
    "Wait, what?"
    "“Of course”? What kind of game is he playing with me?"
    "Is it that he doesn't care about Azzurra at all, and has only made a show of looking for her?"
    "Or does he know where she is, but is trying to play me for a fool?"
    "Or, or, or, could it be that he orchestrated the whole thing?"
    "Lots and lots of different thoughts both relevant and not swirl around in my head. I can only think enough to do one thing in my sorry mental state of affair."
    "I lunged at the fellow, and tossed at his face the most instinctively feral hook I can at once muster."
    A" I am not playing your bloody game, you wretch!"

    "The cold and wetness has sapped much of my strength. Still, the impact was quite enough to knock Hanes off his feet – or maybe it's just because he hasn't expected I would do that."
    "It must have been the fright of his life I am giving him: There I was, standing over him, lightning flashing behind me. It seems a miracle he can even stand up at all."
    "But he did, and grabs me on the shoulder before I can react with another punch or three."

    H" C-calm down! Ana-Anatolio, h-hear me! A-Azzurra's home!"
    A" Wait, what?"
    "My arms fall limp. There's no need for Hanes to restrain me, though perhaps out of self-preservation he still kept my arms locked until he'd be sure I have calmed down,"
    "At which point the rain starts to pick up. The next wave of downpour nicely washes off the dirt on Hanes' robe courtesy of my (undeservedly) violent reaction."
    H" S-see the rain? I-I thought it would b-be good to let A-Azzurra home first, a-and then look for you."
    A" Really now?"
    H" Y-you don't believe me, do you? O-Or would y-you just rather hit me?"
    "True, Hanes' lower lip was swelling. And it's my fault."
    A" H-how's Azzurra?"
    "His hands clamp tightly on my shoulders."

    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" R-rest assured. She's f-fine. As f-fine as can be given the s-situation."
    "He could have given me a punch or ten, and given that confirmation I would have seen it enough of compensation. I should also have apologized, thinking of it."
    "Perhaps I'll do so later down the line."
    A" Th-thank you, Hanes."
    "I grab his hands and shake them as hard as I have ever remembered to."

    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" N-never you mind. Tell-tell you what, Azzurra s-saved herself, somehow. I o-only ran into her on the w-way."
    A" But how?"
    H" That's w-why I can't help you t-there – I know barely b-better than you do."
    H" Go home. G-Go home and see your Azzurra."
    "What else can I do except to run home as quickly as I can and thank the merciful Creator I have such a good friend at my back?"
    "At the end of the day, heavy rain is not without its allure."
    "The light from the houses along the roadside glints upon the wet cobblestone. It looks like a sea of stars under my feet."
    "When I run off, Hanes does give me a few words of warning that I don't catch."
    "Only a while later would I find out this is what he says:"

    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" K-keep an eye out, Anatolio. A-Azzurra is as f-fine as can be given th-the situation. She's still a-a-a bit shaken, I say!"
    "But that is another story for another day."

    "Without a second thought, I hurry through the doorway."
    "If I am right, Azzurra wouldn't lock her doors until much later."

    A" So anyway, how did you get home?"
    "It has taken me quite a long while just waiting for Azzurra to get changed. Even longer, counting the time I decided to let her rest on the situation a bit."

    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" Silly Ana. Why would I not get home?"
    A" I-I mean, how did you escape from that? Did Hanes save you? Did they let you go? Or... what exactly?"
    show Azu P50_1 at center
    Az" Did who let me go?"
    A" Isn't that too clear? Someone kidnapped you into their carriage! That's plain for all to see!"
    show Azu P50_2 at center
    Az" They were just giving me a tour of the place, Ana."

    "What's with that reaction? What's with that absolute calmness of tone?"
    "No, this doesn't sound right. The more I think on it – and I did give it a moment of silence or two – the less sense it makes."
    A" Really, Azzurra? Alright, let's assume someone's kind enough to give you a Merchants' Quarters Guided Tour for free, would it not have made more sense for them to, y'know, tell us before they'd do so, rather than just snatch you like that?"

    show Azu P43 at center
    Az" Well, we did, but you guys didn't hear it."
    A" You've never been a very good liar, Azzurra. Would you please just tell me the truth? I'm worried sick!"


    show Azu P41 at center
    Az" Teehee..."
    A" What's so funny? If I'd known-"
    show Azu P40 at center
    Az" If you'd knew, you wouldn't have gone looking for me, would you?"
    A" …"

    show Azu P38 at center
    Az" Hanes told me everything. How worried you were. How much of a hurry you went off looking. And... that thing where you barged into my place without express permission."
    show Azu P39 at center
    Az" Listen, Ana. I was taken against my will. But then here I am, safe and sound. No damage done, at all!"
    show Azu P37 at center
    Az" No cause for alarm or worry!"
    "There's something incredibly cute about Azzurra's demeanor, such that my cheek starts to flush red."

    show Azu P34 at center
    Az" But then... let me tell you something."

    show Azu P38 at center
    Az" I was afraid. Very, very afraid."

    Az" They kept me gagged. For a time I fell asleep. "
    Az"When I woke up, I was still in the carriage, while the two drivers sit at the front. I don't see their faces, only hear their voices."
    show Azu P42 at center
    Az" They're rather large... and terribly loud. Like my worst nightmare come true."
    Az" They didn't know I've awaken. I pretended to continue sleeping. I think they did try to check on me once or twice... and found nothing strange."

    show Azu P45 at center
    Az" I... I thought it would have been better if I were still in a coma. Then I wouldn't have to hear anything, or know anything any more."
    Az" Let the Creator and His hand arrange my destiny – like a sinner awaiting her final judgement. Business as usual, that's what I thought."
    A" Azzurra…"
    show Azu P43 at center
    Az" But then, I thought of you guys. You've opened my eyes. I'm not a sinner. I've been judged, and proven innocent. "
    Az" There is no reason I have to shut up and take punishment for sins I have not committed!"
    show Azu P42 at center
    Az" That's what I thought then – your words. They keep me calm, and make me feel I'm blessed. The Creator and His Court stands by me, that's how I felt."
    Az" I wanted to escape. I wanted to be free. So I thought I should save myself. I'm pretty sure the door's locked, and there's no way I can break out of it."
    Az"And even if I can, it isn't like I can just jump off a moving carriage unhurt. "
    Az"And even if I can do that, well, trying to run away from a horse-drawn carriage is going to be rather pointless, don't you think?"
    "Azzurra's thought process does, indeed, coincide with mine to a remarkable degree."
    show Azu P52 at center
    Az" But then I still have your pebble. That's the distraction I needed. I toss it out of the glass window, and straight at the carriage driver's back!"
    A" And that works?"
    show Azu P53 at center
    Az" Like a charm! Picture this: All of this happens on a busy street aaaaand raised quite a pretty ruckus. "
    Az" All you need for the people around to look at you is to behave just a little oddly."
    show Azu P54 at center
    Az" One scream and a lot of noisy neighs later, we've got a rather sizable horse of bystanders gathering the carriage. "
    show Azu P53 at center
    Az" Some were curious, and the others thought that, well, my abductors were behaving rather oddly."

    show Azu P41 at center
    Az" While these pleasant folks were caught up with their business, all I needed to do was to sneak of the carriage. "
    Az"Turns out they didn't lock thwe door as securely as they could have, and there I was!"
    show Azu P42 at center
    Az" I thought I should go home right then and there, but then I was afraid maybe these people would be waiting for me there."
    Az" They might know where I live, and that frightened me more than anything."

    show Azu P42 at center
    Az" I could only think to go the the safest place I know: the chapel. There I met Hanes... and he took me home."
    show Azu P53 at center
    Az"  Thankfully, then the rain starts. And it looks like they don't know where I live after all. So I guess I've earned myself a breather."

    Az" So, so, so! Have I earnt myself some compliment for my wits?"

    "What else I can do but give her the nod of approval she deserves?"
    "That's probably an “Exceeds Expectation”."
    "No, better than that. That's amazing. Extraordinary. Astoundingly terrific."
    A" Looks like you didn't need me at the end of the day, did you?"

    show Azu P57 at center
    Az" Not this time, but I will still do in the future. After all, you are my most loyal old guard."
