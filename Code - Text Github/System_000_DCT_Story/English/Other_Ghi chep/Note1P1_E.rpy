    DC"His wheelchair's axle turned and creaked; he reached for some soil, piling it on a sapling's exposed roots."
    CB"Why so? It doesn't look that interesting, surely?"
    DC"The old man rubbed the boy's forehead with his dirt-smeared hand. As all boys did, he did not mind the dirt."

\n The land you now dwell shall be eternally guarded and sheltered by my disciples three, like the protecting hands of a parent, and over them shall I ever keep watch.
\n The land you now dwell, by my will, shall be endowed with flora and fauna rich and plentiful in equal measures, blessed with sun and rain and the monsoon, so your descendants shall prosper for all eternity.

The story begins from the opening days of history, when there was but earth and water beneath the blue sky. From the peak of the Vitus Mountains, the Shield of the World, three great rivers spread, in three directions, down into the plain below, like three colossal pythons. Their tributaries branched all across the lands, dividing the land into three great sub-continent: the North, the West and the South. These lands three, guarded by the Saints also numbered three, in pairs. The South is watched over by St. Jove and St. Lucina; The West, St. Astraea and St. Jove; and the North, Lucina and Astraea. Each of the Saint also took charge of one great river, also named after them.
\n These rivers then meet at one single point: Lake Meyr, the Heart of the World.

    CB"So that's how it is, gramps?"
    OC"Not too many people remember these stories nowadays."
    DC"His voice was calm and proud – a pride he did not bother hiding."
    CB"Dad never told me any of that."
    OC"Heh. I wouldn't blame him for not knowing!"
    DC"And then he laughed heartily. I had never seen him more excited."
    CB"Tell me, gramps! Tell me more, pleeeeease?"
    OC"Tell me, gramps! Tell me more, pleeeeease?"
    DC"At that time, I was simply admiring him in much the same way I would admire anyone endowed with knowledge and experience."

    nvlDC"The South – where we live – is the City of the Gods, where the first men who walked the earth settled down. That was then, that is now; we, as the Creator willed it, all live here. At first we were few, and few things happened: the land west of the Great River Jove on my left, here, was all that we needed."

    nvlDC"Indeed, on the other side of the Jove lies the Western Continent, the Lord's Land within the Lord's City – also known as the Sacred Plain. It is a historical name that still bear significance today: you can imagine how holy the land has to be, under the patronage of the Saint of the Skies Jove and the Saint of Justice Astraea. Nobody sets a foot on its soil – much less dwell here – without a healthy dose of piety. "

    OC"That was the story of many decades before us. Things are... different now. "
    OC"You see, we thrive and multiply. We're running out of place to live... within, and without."
    OC"In this North, civilization grows. It 's good land, you see, for business and for living. The place for the moneyed folks. That's where the Market and the Merchant's Guild and the nobility make their home."
    DC"His voice was tired and defeated, though he concealed the greater depths of his thoughts from the boy."
    CB"Awesome!"

    CB"Gramps?"
    OC"What is it?"
    CB"Gramps, why do you know so much? My grandpa never told me all that!"
    DC"Oh, blessed was the innocence of a child."
    OC" …"
    DC"He rubbed the boy's forehead again."
    OC"Well, m'boy, that's because I'm just a wee older than your grandfather. "
    CB"Really? So in a wee bit my grandpa will tell me all that much too, right?"
    OC"But of course."
