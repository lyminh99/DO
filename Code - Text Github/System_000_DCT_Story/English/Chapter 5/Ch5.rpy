    "I have had a rather odd dream."
    "I dreamt I was returning to an old place from an old time."
    "Then I took Azzurra to an old oak stump. A really old and truly enormous one: took more than our arms together to make even halfway around its perimeter."
    "Its bulging roots looked just like a host of serpents and pythons, brown and rough and curling and tough as iron all over, as if rushing from the very core of its being and burrowing underneath the dirt, waiting for an unwitting prey to come by. Then they would pounce."
    "Yep, that sounded like what predators are wont to do, didn't it?"

    show Azu P40 at center
    Az" So wouldn't the side roots be like those little snakes keeping an eye on thing for the rest of the host? Like, you know, the re-cog-nai-sance or something?"
    "Azzurra points to the cluster of hanging foliage. Her imagination, at times, exceeds even mine."
    A" That's the one!"


    "I clapped. That's what I do, all the time, in her presence."

    show Azu P43 at center
    Az" That's scary!"
    A" Well, that's probably because it kind of is? Gramps liked to tell me that's what serpents and pythons do. They stay motionless all day, studying their prey and little else."
    A" And then when the sun sets, against the red dusk and the evening breeze, the ginormous pythons would wake up, and that's it for their targets!"
    A" Over there, behind you! It's moving!"

    show Azu P49 at center
    Az" Not buying it!"
    "Azzurra turned away and pursed her lips, yet that little start on her shoulder isn't deceiving anybody. "
    "You know the sort: a chill along your spine that just happens to come for the silliest of reasons, but may unnerve even the bravest."
    "I suppose the mental image of enough snakes to devour an army would do that to you. Strangely, that's when Azzurra looks the cutest to my eyes."
    "But then, we all know those roots and branches were just that: Roots and branches. No serpents or pythons around there."
    "But then I should probably change the topic. Azzurra's imagination has a way of going too far."

    Az" Anatolio? I have an idea!"
    A" Yeah?"

    show Azu P40 at center
    Az" Wanna draw me next to this tree?"
    "So Azzurra'd done the hard part for me. That was a pleasant surprise."
    A" What brought that about?"

    show Azu P41 at center
    Az" Anatolio. How do you like the sunset?"
    A" Eh... that's rather cool, I think?"
    show Azu P42 at center
    Az" Why the 'rather cool' part?"
    A" Well, uh—"
    A" No reason, I guess."

    "Tôi trả lời chiếu lệ."

    "My brain shook and rattled like a clunky piece of work, then rumbled to life."
    A" Dawn and dusk are both good in their own ways, I think. That's the time where the sky changes. And they are extraordinary, too."
    A"You see red, then you see yellow, then you see shades of the rainbow mixed in that diffusal of light. You can hardly see the same dawn or dusk again. Olus, you never see a pallid or borind color there."
    A" And you know me. I happen to rather like special things – and the color red. That's about it."
    "Azzurra remained silent. She looked at the ground, her eyes following a line of marching ants, one after another disappearing into the depth of their colony."
    "Then she looked to the sky."

    show Azu P45 at center
    Az"How I see it, dusk is that time you see the sky like the yolk of an egg, and so gentle unlike the light of dawn." 
    show Azu P54 at center
    Az"And it doesn't last, too, quite unlike the cloudless white of the noon sky or the deep sadness of the black night."
    show Azu P41 at center
    Az" Yet they talk of sunset as it it were the end of a day. Or of sunrise like a new and fresh beginning. What do you think, Ana?"
    A" Well, there is a reason why dusk tends to be melancholic, and dawn hopeful, is there?"

    "But then people don't, I still think, dislike the dusk. Perhaps that's because there is something else to it, too."

    show Azu P40 at center
    Az" Well, I find that reason to be rather unfair."
    show Azu P38 at center
    Az" You see, in a sense, isn't dusk the beginning of night in its own right, while dawn its end?"
    show Azu P33_1 at center
    Az" I say, if beginning and end are just two sides of the same coin, why can't we see it that way? " 
    show Azu P38 at center
    Az"Why are people so afraid of the end?" 
    show Azu P40 at center
    Az" Don't they hope that the end of one will bring about the beginning of an even better other?Would the fear of the closure of one thing just plain fade when you accept such end and such beginning as they are?"

    "I felt the atmosphere around me condensing. So does my emotions. Azzurra's comment did have that sort of effect."
    "And yet—"

    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" What's so funny, Ana? What did I get wrong?"
    "Yes, I was laughing. Though not at Azzurra's uncharacteristically philosophical thoughts; rather with it. I guess this didn't translate too well to Azzurra – she was pouting at me again."
    A" No, not at all, you are too right. I'm just surprised you're saying such profound things. Unlike you, y'see."
    show Azu P47 at center
    Az" Well am I a girl of many surprises."
    "Then I lay down on the grass. Hundreds of fluffy clouds (condensed from a million droplets of vapor) swirled in the sky, themselves forming up so many wondrous shapes."
    A" You're right. It would be better if people would just accept."
    A" But then, y'know what, Azzurra?"
    show Azu P40 at center
    Az" Know what?"
    A" That's because human beings cannot let go."

    show Azu P50_1 at center
    Az" What does that mean?"
    "Azzurra widened her eyes."
    A" Y'see, a tiger would leave her cub in the wild after but three years without looking back. After that, mother and cub would become two separate entities. Neither would have anything to do with the other any more."
    A" Same goes a lot of other species in the animal kingdom. After the offspring matures, they'd let them go, and that would be the end of that."
    A" That's not the same for us humans. We'd like to prolong our time next to each other. Even as we age, we would loathe to part with any friend or relative if we can help it."
    A" Are we not innately fearful of the end?"
    A" Well, Gramps did say at some point, that man is not afraid of death, he only loves life too much."
    A" What do you think?"

    show Azu P53 at center
    Az" ..."
    A" Me, I think humans aren't even afraid of letting go of life all that much."
    A" You see so many people – take them folks in Aurora for once – who were pretty much not afraid of dying at all."
    A" Rather, we are afraid of letting go of that which we have gained. Relationships, achievements, fame, prestige, that sort of things."
    A" That which have begun, we are loathe to let go. That is just part of us – what makes us human."
    A" Same for your anxiousness, really. Sometimes, there are things you shouldn't compromise just to feel better about it. And..."
    "But then Azzurra cleared her voice before I could finish my sentence,"

    Az" How about I put it another way? This view is awesomely pretty, and I want to see it recorded down. In my head, and on paper."

    "Azzurra has since regained much of her confidence."
    "Speaking of which, her erudition seems to have increased exponentially of late. I can't believe I'll have to say this, but there is now preciously little in which I can actually claim superiority over her enough to teach her."
    "I guess this is the part I should be afraid I'd fall behind, in addition to all of my other anxieties."

    "I don't think there's any coincidental “happenstances” here."
    "And I would not be wrong."
    "See, Azzurra's existence has brought upon me countless troubles. From day one, if everything adds up."
    "Troubles that, at the end of the day, aren't her fault."
    "If I am to blame anyone, that would be her yet unknown parents who'd abandoned her in the middle of the unforgiving public and left her cold and starving. I reckon they'd be out there, part of the crowd so mercilessly condemning her, and lift not a finger."
    "Now there's only Hanes, Father Fredo and my family that remain firmly on Azzurra's side."
    "Well, but what can I do about that? If I continue dwelling on that which I can't help... well, I'd like my face looking upbeat when I can help it, thank you very much!"

    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" Ana? What's the matter?"

    "I was thinking, as per usual. Of the one way I know to keep Azzurra safe and sound. A, well, truly failsafe way if there is one."

    A" How about we just return to the shop and wait it out."

    Az" Eh, didn't you say we'll go see Elena again after lunch?"

    nvlDC"\n I did say that? I don't think I recall..."
    nvlDC"\n Whether I have indeed suggested so or not, it speaks measures to Azzurra's... daring, wanting to cross the bridge again just days after that incident. Or maybe she'd hit her head real hard, so the trauma of that day is no longer with her."
    nvlDC"\n It is, however, true that the next time I saw her after the whole thing at the forest, Elena did suggest bringing some disguise that Azzurra can use next time she (or I) get the brilliant idea to come over again."
    nvlDC"\n It's best that Azzurra don't come close to the rich and noble folks for as long as I can keep her, now that I've cleared my mind and kept my thoughts realistic."
    nvlDC"\n Now, there is one thing I was wondering from that last time."
    nvlDC"\n How did Azzurra get away so easily?"
    nvlDC"\n The story she told me did make some sense, especially since I have over the last few days learnt that she is perhaps much, much more than I usually give her credit for."
    nvlDC"\n But then no matter how smart or brave or awesome Azzurra is (or has become), it was still a girl versus two tall, large and probably murderous hired thugs."
    nvlDC"\n What if someone rescued her? It is a possibility, though that someone cannot be Hanes, and if that had been the case, why did he not say anything about it?"
    nvlDC"\n The other possibility is that they let her go themselves."
    nvlDC"\n No, that makes no sense either. Those who would try to kidnap Azzurra probably hate her as much as the rest of the richer half of town, or had been hired by those who wish she'd never been born. Why would they let her go without so much as a scratch? Without even a threat or two?"
    nvlDC"\n Besides, however I look at it the Church and the rest of the City authority would not take very kindly to an act of abduction, not even if it was this most hated person. Seems like too much of a risk just to make a shallow impression on good old Azzurra, no?"
    nvlDC"\n I can't see any shrewd merchant or savvy politician doing this sort of nonsense."
    nvlDC"\n Let's revisit the first hypothesis, then."
    nvlDC"\n Suppose someone, a force still operating from the shadow, came across Azzurra in her time of dire needs, and very kindly saved her (with or without great risk to their person, let's not argue that right now)."
    nvlDC"\n That hypothetical someone did so either through ludicrous use of force (Because large and tall thugs), or through some sort of... pressure."
    nvlDC"\n So that would either be a nobleman, or a member of the clergy."
    nvlDC"\n Or someone with lots and lots of cash to go around – landowners, merchants, caravan masters. The sort who goes to places on gilded carriage, swings around a fat purse of gold coins or a dozen, and dine on caviar twice a day."
    nvlDC"\n Now, does that sound familiar? Do I know someone who possesses this sort of power?"
    nvlDC"\n Better question, do I know a heiress to such a family?"
    nvlDC"\n By the Creator, I do. I do indeed. To be exact, a haughty and sassy, yet ultimately good-hearted young noble lady with a penchant for strange linguistic syntax and the color crimson."
    nvlDC"\n That means I, once again, owe Elena a big one."
    nvlDC"\n Thinking of it, should I perhaps thank her in person?"
    nvlDC"\n … would she even accept it?"
    nvlDC"\n The answers “yes” and “no” are equally probable. If and when Elena does anything, she usually has her own reasons that she wouldn't tell anyone."
    nvlDC"\n Indeed, knowing Elena, perhaps she doesn't even one to be credited for saving Azzurra (if my hypothesis is to be true)."
    nvlDC"\n Besides, gratefulness doesn't always need to be expressed by words. If I can do Elena one good turn, that would be good enough. Knowing Elena, maybe I can... somehow."

    "BLAM!"
    "So, what is it the old folks like to say? “Books can kill”? I'm not sure if they meant it literally. Merciful Creator, the pile that has just collapsed next to me could have well claimed a life!"
    "My eyes fix upon a thick tome bound with so much leather and a bit of metal. That could have well been the end of me and my Sun Festival aspirations."
    "A long sigh escapes my nostrils. What am I even doing here again? To help Azzurra clean up? Or to make a bigger mess of the place?"
    "But then I press my hand against my chest. Someone has to take care of Azzurra's book pile. That's why she gave me her key, right? Me, Anatolio Pietro the Great, rather than, say, Dad, or Mom, or even Hanes."
    "It just makes sense that it's now my responsibility to take care of this library, isn't it? If Azzurra doesn't come back..."
    "No, what am I thinking? Of course Azzurra will come back, she promised as much!"
    "I pick up the book, dust it over, and place it back on the table where Azzurra likes to sit."
    "There's a little bookmark at about the middle of the volume. Azzurra has hardly covered the whole thing."
    A" ‘Commentarii de Bello Gallico’ – with commentaries from Sallow Edwards và John Graham."
    "But she did tell me about its content. It's something of a fairy tale, about a tyrant and his cruel invasion that results in thousands upon thousands of people killed. At the end of the day, that tyrant is stabbed to death by his own men in his own castle."
    "“Well that stabbing isn't in this book. Pretty sure there's another much thinner volume that records that,” was what she told me."
    "That's fair enough. I'm not one to take interest in works of fiction thick enough to stop doors. Useless, made-up stories, made by equally useless ne'er-do-wells with a penchant for overly active imagination."
    "“Isn't that a waste of paper?” I would tell Azzurra that much."
    "I'd earn myself a stern look and/or a knock on the shoulder. “Stories are stories!” she'd say indignantly."
    A" A... waste of paper. Am I right, Azzurra?"

    nvlDC"\n This time, there is no more stern look, or knock on the shoulder."
    nvlDC"\n I stand down, and lean against the shelf with both hands falling to my side."
    nvlDC"\n My only company this time is the sound of wind howling against the gap in the window, and some creaking hinges in dire need of some oil."
    nvlDC"\n Azzurra is no longer here."
    nvlDC"\n Just a few days ago, I was still happy to see Azzurra willing to stay with us. Then came that day, and she's now off to her own family – her own destiny as Hanes had so flowerly put it. Now there's only me – who has failed to keep her."
    nvlDC"\n That's not even the worst part: that would be how I have no reason not to accept life without her as a new normal. Before she left, she did bring around her aunt and uncle, and they even spent a while saying farewell to my parents – and thanking me of all people."
    nvlDC"\n I didn't look too mature that day, to be sure, still not certain I would accept that life without Azzurra. But today, when the childishness fades and the about-to-come-of-age, I have to admit: They do not look like bad people."
    nvlDC"\n Azzurra, too, seems content with her new life: happier, and more lively for want of better words."
    nvlDC"\n Azzurra's uncle looks like your typical stern and stoic old man, yet true to his words. Her aunt appears more sociable and quite a bit more of a dandy, but still a likable woman irregardless."
    nvlDC"\n Now they are farmers, something of a small landholder even, in a distant village far in the outskirt, about a day's distance from the City by carriage."
    nvlDC"\n “An outpost of the Creator and His Court in the wilderness,” they said proudly. “To protect and preserve the Faith before those who would do it harm.”"
    nvlDC"\n Appearance might well lie, but their demeanor did allay my greatest fear – although I'm not going to admit that out loud, not in this life."
    nvlDC"\n I don't remember so well what we discussed after that – just that there'd been quite a lively exchange."
    nvlDC"\n Well, except one thing that Azzurra said."

    A" You're a fool, Anatolio. Your wish cannot change reality, no matter how much you want."
    "Fact of the matter, Azzurra is no longer around."
    "I pat on the covers of the books littering on the table, as if they were meticulously made, fluffy plush dolls."
    A" Sad, aren't you?"
    "I ask, and answer myself. With a shake of the head"
    A" No need to be. Azzurra... is happy, isn't she? Happier than I am, at least!"
    "Happy. Azzurra is happy. Isn't that enough?"
    "Says you, Anatolio Pietro. Now be truthful to yourself. Would you not be happier if Azzurra were to be unhappy yet on your side? If you can see her, talk to her, hold her hands, nothing else matters, is that not right?"
    "I shake my head. No. Anatolio Pietro isn't that petty, is he?"
    "But that is your heart's desire, is that not right?"
    A" That's... that is not..."
    "I am no stranger to you. You've never changed, Anatolio. You make a front of being this noble and headstrong spirit, but deep inside you're little better than wet paper. You're afraid. Fearful. You would run away from anything, if you could get away with it."
    A" That's wrong!"

    "{i}Well, then, but this City is so peaceful, no? {/i}"
    "{i}Nothing to be afraid of. No ghosts or evil spirits. {/i}"
    "{i}Monsters have been eliminated by the Creator's Court long before you were even born. You're only afraid of that which has no shape and form. You're afraid of being ignoble. Being ignorant and stupid. Being disparaged and looked down upon.{/i}"


    A" No, no, no! I am..."

    "{i}Oh, well, but you are! And most of all, do you know what you most fear? Loneliness. That's the bane of your heart, and it's troubling you right about now, and that's why you're even here.{/i}"

    "{i}That's why you're rearranging Azzurra's bookcases, one day after another. There's a facade you have to keep up, am I right? That you are needed here, that you have some kind of purposes to fulfill in doing all this, one day to another. {/i}"
    "{i}Though you and me, we both know, you aren't solving a single blasted thing wasting your time here. {/i}"
    A" S-shut up! I'm not listening!"

    "{i}Well, dear me, I will, but then I am you as you are me, right? And as you, I want you not to run away and hide behind those memories, and drop that mask of being this noble ser both brave and smart in equal measures. Now go out there, and face the truth. Do what you need to do.{/i}"
    "{i}The Sun Festival is just around the corner. You're not a little boy no more.{/i}"
    "{i}Do what you need.{/i}"
    "{i}At once I feel like smashing my head against the wall. The inner boy within me wishes to throw a final tantrum.{/i}"

    A" Do what I need to do, eh..."
    "And then my intention gets cut in half. Someone is knocking."
    "That's strange. Everyone's known that Azzurra's no longer staying here, and this house is largely deserted. Am I just hearing things, or...?"
    "Knock, knock, knock, goes the door again."
    "Alright, my ears aren't wrong. Someone is really knocking."
    "What shall I do then?"
    "I rack my brain for half a minute, and then decide I'll stay put. Without anyone answering the call, whoever the visitor is, they'd know they've come to the wrong place."
    "The third time the knocking comes, I thought it was enough to shake the entire street. I make a point to keep my eyes shut and my ears covered."
    "Nobody's here, people, nobody."
    "At long last, the knocking stops, and that is the end of that."


    A" Good riddance..."
    nvlDC"\n To be sure, I decide not to go downstairs until after a while. I stay absolutely still: no more clearing, no more pacing, no more making any noise louder than muffled breathing. Let's not give the visitor any clue..."
    nvlDC"\n My hand flicks a few pages of that book, Commentarii de Bello Gallico, my eyes skimming over whichever line I see."
    nvlDC"\n “There are many things you can learn from old books.”"
    nvlDC"\n The line hits my eyes with the force of a sledgehammer. As if hypnotized, I stare at the page, part of me wanting to bore right through it."
    nvlDC"\n How long have I been sitting there, just looking at those words?"
    nvlDC"\n I just know that an era and a half seemed to have passed by the time I stand up and step downstairs."
    nvlDC"\n Outside, the visitor has well and truly gone."
    nvlDC"\n I'm just about to take a deep, long breath I deserve when my eyes find an object previously not there before."
    nvlDC"\n A tiny envelope, pushed through the gap under the door."
    nvlDC"\n A very curious me pick up the envelope..."
    nvlDC"\n … and a chill runs down my spine."
    nvlDC"\n On one side there is the image of a sun rising beyond what looks like a snow-covered peak."

    nvl clear

    A" Au-Aurora?"
    "I turn over the envelope."
    "No, there is no mistake about it. The sign was carefully inked, and has a certain official-looking air about it."
    "I have seen that symbol once. In one of the history books on the strife of the previous decades, that I read through during the past three years."
    "In fact, that history book was one of the only place you can find that symbol these days. Following the war so many decades before, that symbol has been banned by the Church. As in, just drawing that sign is an offense punishable by imprisonment."
    "And that symbol is now resting right here, in my hand."
    "I am shuddering and trembling all over."
    "What is this supposed to mean?"
    "Did someone intend to frame me up or something? I've done no wrong to anyone!"
    "No, no, calm down, Anatolio. You're too young to get tangled in this matter."
    "I'm going to protect myself! I'll turn this over to Father Fredo – he'd know what to do, right? Of course he would! The Church authority might even reward me for my honesty and conviction to do the right thing!"
    "But then, curiosity has that propensity to murder kittens."
    "I look at the envelope again, finding it harder and harder to tear my eyes from it with every passing second."
    A" I'll reseal it... I'll reseal it... I'll reseal it..."
    "My heart skips a beat as I remove the seal."
    "Inside, there is just one piece of paper written with a terse, soulless print writing."
    "“Azzurra. Business. At ten. Lake. Alone.”"
    A" A-Azzurra?"


    nvlDC"\n I gasp, gulp and inhale quickly. All of that doesn't quite calm me down just yet, but it goes a long way."
    nvlDC"\n No, I must not be hasty. I must consider everything. Everything."
    nvlDC"\n Again I stare at the tiny piece of paper."
    nvlDC"\n Fact one: This isn't Azzurra's writing. So this most likely isn't Azzurra's doing. There's a possibility that whatever is going on is an enormous prank or a frame-up. Something Elena can cook up, no doubt?"
    nvlDC"\n No, Elena is enormously capable of doing far more insidious thing to me if she likes. Things that are also infinitely safer to herself and hers. Things that do not involve impersonating the resident Faction of Evil."
    nvlDC"\n What about Hanes? Not a chance. He is a member of the clergy now, and understands all too well Aurora isn't something to be trifled with or joked about. Church rules are stricter to their own members than the public, for good reason."
    nvlDC"\n Besides, I understand Hanes all too well. So pious and easily frightened, anything Aurora-related is probably anathema to him – or at least to what he has lately become."
    nvlDC"\n That, and I don't think I've made an enemy so bitter they'd have to set me up with such an elaborate scheme."
    nvlDC"\n That leaves me one possibility."
    nvlDC"\n I hold my breath."
    nvlDC"\n It might actually be the real thing. Which begs the question: What do they want with me? Or Azzurra, for that matter?"
    nvlDC"\n I swallow hard."
    nvlDC"\n This is very probably a letter of appointment."
    nvlDC"\n If it is the real thing, that means some Aurora people, whoever they are, wish to see me tonight at the lake to discuss something involving Azzurra."
    nvlDC"\n What can I do?"
    nvlDC"\n I can do what they say... and suffer terrible consequences if this is a trap or a set-up."
    nvlDC"\n I can see Hanes and give it to him. He'd be overjoyed to have that opportunity to prove himself useful to his superiors."
    nvlDC"\n I can see Father Fredo himself, and trust in his wisdom and experience dealing with these people."
    nvlDC"\n Or I can give it over to my parents and have the ultimate faith in the infallibility of those who gave birth to me."
    nvlDC"\n The last option is silly. Knowing my parents the only thing they'd do is to give it over to Father Fredo, in which case I'd do better just hand the thing in myself."

    "So, what do I do now?"
