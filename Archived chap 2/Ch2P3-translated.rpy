    H" R-right. The second q-question was the musician's: A g-guitarist has his strings break in-in the middle of a p-performance. He replaced them w-with all haste. Will the new strings be on-on or off-key?"

    H" T-that m-makes sense."


    nvlDC"\n Hanes nodded and nodded. I get this vibe that he's playing me for a tool. On purpose."
    nvlDC"\n Wait a second. If that were the case... then wouldn't the right answer be “on-key”?"
    nvlDC"\n “On-key” versus “off-key”. Hmm."
    nvlDC"\n I have to admit Azzurra does make some kind of sense in this case. The new string has to be a critical clue."
    nvlDC"\n But then the question also described the musician as “experienced”, and that the strings were “replaced”. Even if he had been a complete greenhorn, well, there is an astronomically minuscule chance the strings would be done right from the get go."
    nvlDC"\n So the answer would by all means been “it can go either way”. And yet the question demanded a single-word answer. What a predicament."
    nvlDC"\n Above all, you have to give me that there's something monumentally odd about the question, easily missable at the first hear. It wasn't me, but Azzurra who saw it. It is only when she reminded me that I looked at it from that angle."
    nvlDC"\n I give the hastily-scrawled question another read."
    nvlDC"\n Will the new strings be on-key or off-key?"
    nvlDC"\n As you can see, the wording of the question alone is weird. Equally weird is how Hanes read only the question verbatim while leaving the rest of it (actually quite lengthy in writing) abbreviated."
    nvlDC"\n Will the new strings be on-key?"
    nvlDC"\n Will the new strings be off-key?"
    nvlDC"\n That's how people should normally ask."
    nvlDC"\n Unless, of course..."

    "“That was the answer” might very well been the most miserable announcement Hanes has made today."
    " As expected, he made sure he'd turned me over and over again with those whats and whys that weren't part of the original question."
    " And as per usual, I answered in a manner I am sure Azzurra would have a hard time understanding."
    "And that would be no logical fallacy on my part. The answer is, indeed, quite hard to elaborate."
    "Truth being, it was no more than a word play. The question “Will the new strings be on-key or off-key” implies an either-or possibility."
    " And in this one case, it really IS either-or: there is simply no third option available. The statement is axiomatically true."
    "There can, therefore, be no answer other than “Yes”. Truly a crude application of a Mathematician's Answer, but there you have it."

    nvlDC"\n “A wealthy nobleman lives in a secluded mansion. He employs six servants in all. One summer Sunday, five of the six servants each were given a certain task."
    nvlDC"\n The first claimed he was weeding and tending to the garden. The second said he was mending the roof and the attic. These two did converse with each other during break. The third, for her part, said she went to the market. On this particular day she got up late, and had to browse through three market lanes to find all the food the estate needed."
    nvlDC"\n The fourth went to the chapel – the authorities were taking issues with a manufactury in the nobleman's employ and he supposed working with the Church may result in a way around that. En route this person met the third coming back from her shopping run, as well as the fifth. Now this fifth person was making a delivery from the manufactury. Given the aforementioned problem with the authorities he had to wait for an approval from the Church – which the fourth servant was getting. Then the fourth and fifth servant handled the rest of the delivery."
    nvlDC"\n Now the sixth was an elderly butler who was also the chef. He was certain thar none of the above five did anything suspicious in the kitchen before going on with the day's work. He was a bit under the weather, and got permission to rest until lunch. None of the other five claimed to have returned home before lunch. It was almost mealtime when two guests arrived at the estate, and the nobleman had the butler fetch a bottle of aged wine for the occasion. The guests drained their glasses, while the nobleman took his time enjoying the taste. Yet barely had he finished when he dropped dead before the horrified eyes of all present."
    nvlDC"\n Assuming it wasn't the butler who did it, the cellar was locked, the glasses are identical, and each man randomly picked their drink. Everyone's task would have theoretically left them indisposed for the whole morning and none has the capacity to do another's. All tasks were finished. Given all these facts, how was it possible that the murderer did the deed, and who might he be?”"

    "Note to self: Don't show Azzurra any detective novels involving people being eviscerated any time soon."


    A" Hmm..."


    nvlDC"\n In the meantime, let's get back to this quasi-detective work."
    nvlDC"\n Let's sum up the facts."
    nvlDC"\n The nobleman fell dead after draining his glass. Obviously something is wrong with the drink. But since the cellar is securely locked... someone has to have fiddled with the glass itself."
    nvlDC"\n Back to the suspects. All six claimed to have been doing something at the time. Nobody was in the kitchen or in contact with the drink or the glass – nobody, except for the butler. The butler, surprise surprise, is also the only one without a verifiable witness. Double whammy, he is also the only one handling both glass and bottle. Nobody else has more convenience doing the deed."
    nvlDC"\n But then the question stated the assumption that he did not do it. So the culprit is among the other five. But then none of them went back home for lunch. It is equally preposterous to suspect the guests, for obvious reasons."
    nvlDC"\n So it is either the nobleman who killed himself, or someone was a big fat liar. Assuming the geezer wasn't the type to off himself, then who was the liar?"
    nvlDC"\n Back to the servants: I can divide them into two groups. Servant 1 and 2 were gardening, and Servant 3, 4 and 5 were out of the estate doing their things. Everyone in a group could testify for everyone else in the same group."
    nvlDC"\n So if one lied, that means the whole group must be colluding."
    nvlDC"\n But the question remains, who?"
    nvlDC"\n To visualize the info"
    
    nvlDC"
\n Group A (didn't leave the homestead):
\n 1.	Gardener  Met #2
\n 2.   Roof-mender  Met #1
\n 
    "
    nvlDC"
\n Nhóm B (bên ngoài):
\n 3.   Shopping
\n 4.   Met with Church officials  Met #3 and #5
\n 5.   Delivering goods  Met #4
\n 
    "

    nvlDC"\n Logically those who didn't leave the estate had a far better opportunity to meddle with the drink."
    nvlDC"\n A possibility is the second person sneaked into the kitchen while mending the roof and tampered with the glass; then lied about it together with the first servant. The result is a poisoned glass and a dead nobleman."
    nvlDC"\n I can't say I'm sure, but let's give it a go either way."

    nvl clear

    A" Group A. I mean, the roof-mender."
    "Then I explain the reasoning I've just come up with. It all seems to match and click, at least in my mind."
    "But then Hanes... wasn't exactly approving."

    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" Bzzt! N-nope! Wrongie-doo, pal!"
    "How blunt. I take his declaration about as well as I would an arrow in the chest: defensively."
    A" Well, how would I be wrong? You've got to agree those in the house are that much more likely to do the deed. If it wasn't the butler, it has to be the other two."
    "That, or the second group. But then that case would make even less sense."

    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" My d-dear Anatolio. Think a-about it. Is it at all possible y-you've left something out? Think again. T-there is one vital clue you've l-left untouched, isn't there?"
    A" A vital clue?"
    "How quaint, Hanes dropping a clue of sort. Being reminded of something I missed isn't what I expect to come from the guy."
    "Indeed, I've almost forgotten. Each and every job was perfectly done within the theoretical allotted time."
    A" Any possibility that the second servant did it faster than he normally did?"
    "It's a vague assumption. Nobody can theoretically map out the exact time that a person needs for any given particular task. And if it is a vague assumption, well, that's something I could use to back myself up."
    H" N-nope! That's not where the problem lies!"
    "Hanes clicks his tongue and shrugs."
    H" What you forgot is: The two guest are com-completely unharmed!"
    H" If someone did tamper with the wine, we'd have had a tri-triple homicide! Also, t-the butler is the only one having access to the cellar!"
    A" He could have smeared poison on the glass."
    H" How, then, co-could he make sure the nob-nobleman's the one who gets it? Remember the glasses are randomly p-picked! Same for the actual bottle of wine!"
    A" P-perhaps the culprit was a serial killer wannabe? He didn't care who gets the glass so long as someone falls dead?"
    H" Wouldn't it make more sense to po-poison all three glasses then?"
    A"……………."

    "Well, there goes my reasoning. Hanes, you're right this time."
    "So three people took the wine. Only the host bit the dust. That's the culprit's goal. Maddening, I know."
    "Servant #1 and #2 are each other's witness."
    "Servant #4 is a witness for #3 and #5. #5 is quite certain he met #1."
    "Who else could have done the deed?"
    "Did the nobleman decide to elaborately kill himself?"
    H" N-o-p-e!"
    "To be fair, Hanes didn't need to stomp my answer into the dirt like that."
    H" By the by, l-let me reveal something. Th-the three answers you've g-given? That's how these three nearly sta-started fighting."
    A" That bar brawl you said?"
    H" Y-yep, that one. The same thing that had Hanes t-the Pal-pally charge in to solve."
    H" W-well, I don't actually kn-know the details. Just that t-they gave the swame answers t-that you did. But the teacher, well, h-he said they're all wrong. Then the other two guys, t-they said the same thing you said. Also app-apparently wrong, according to the tea-teacher fellow."
    H" He didn't g-give his own answer, mind you, saying that he wants it t-to be food for thought for the other guys."
    H" W-who could stand that, don't you agree? Especially when it's good m-money at stake. It might well be a c-cheat! So there they started ar-arguing. The engineer and the musician said the teacher didn't play fair, the teacher insisted he did. Aaaaand the rest, as you'd s-say, is history."
    H" Took this noble Pal-Paladin a while to restore the peace! I can be pr-pretty awesome at times, if I have to s-say that myself!"
    "That is a surprisingly elaborate description of the situation. Unfortunately, it is also thoroughly unhelpful for the guy who simply wants an answer to this quiz: me."
    H" So, und-understandably, you're wrong."
    "If that was indeed the case, there is certainly something missing in my reasoning. I don't find my analysis quite convincing to myself. Yet, admitting defeat also means..."
    A" So you don't have an answer yourself?"
    H" Unfortunately, f-for just this one."
    "So much for wanting a final satisfaction to round off Hanes' sleight of head. The disappointment is almost material."
    "“Well, shoot!”. Who knows, maybe Hanes himself is curious too? He wants an answer, of course, and would even ask for it if he could."
    "That's one feeling I can totally get around. I give up. It's just a game, isn't it? Should we waste as much mind power on it as we are?"
    "Then I hear the bell tower strike three in the afternoon. School time for me and Azzurra. We've made it a habit, and I do try not to break it."
    "Normally this sound would fill me with a certain kind of dread. Not today, though: It's given me the perfect reason to call it quits."
    A" Why, look at the time. I've got to go now – maybe I'll try this again later?"
    H" Eh?"
    "Hanes sounds a bit startled. Not just surprised, but a bit... frightened, even. For some reason."
    A" Well, I've got to go. To teach Azzurra. As for these trick questions, maybe I'll be able to come up with something at home?"
    "Home. And quietness. That should help me think clearer and better. Makes sense, right?"
    "Hanes, however, doesn't seem to be too much in agreement."
    H" E-eh…"
    "He looks distracted. Distracted, and disappointed. Looks like he's been betting a lot on my answering – or not being able to."
    "“Sorry for that”, is all I can say. Azzurra is equally apologetic. Then we turn around, and march through the doorway."
    A" See you later!"
    "We never speak of those puzzles from that day on."
    "I never know if Hanes ever gets the solution."
    "I never ask. For fear of having to try to answer it again."

    "They often say evil spirits like to haunt innocent folks in the dead of night. Nobody say a man of the cloth would have the same habit – yet here he is."
    "Now before my eyes, as the night was still young, was that spectral presence of a certain Hanes, who has somehow found his way into my place unbidden and stands before me even as my thoughts struggle to form."
    "My first reaction was jumping up in a start. My second was screaming the lights out. The third, tossing a punch in his general direction that may or may not have connected."
    "This'd be my fourth reaction in a row."

    H" T-the fifth, actually."
    "Telepathy it might be, but that Hanes is apparently privy to thoughts of my own."
    "Now somehow I'm just able to maintain my calm – not angry nor screaming, as if the thing before me were just something akin to Mom's Caesar salad. Absolutely loathsome, but an acquired taste after a while. I take a deep breath and drown my drowsiness, and then begin:"
    A" What is the matter, Hanes?"

    H" Oh! F-follow me, please!"
    "Now why he was smiling, or what he was saying, I don't think I or anyone in my shoes would understand. I'd thought being so unfathomable was a prerogative only Father Fredo is entitled to, not my dear old Hanes."
    "Do I have a reason to care, though?"
    A" Nah. Good luck with whatever."
    "I don't, to be fair. Because I'd be rolling up in my blanket and fall back to sleep. That's exactly what I am doing."

    H" H-haven't I said all that I know?"
    A" Hmph. Let's give it the benefit of the doubt."
    A" So Father Fredo heard?"
    "I paraphrase in my mind Hanes' overly lengthy narration. And true to my imagination, all I get from him this time is a curt “A-aye”."

    "Well, in any case the story isn't as grave as I initially thought. This is what happened, if I am to summarize in about a twentieth as many words as Hanes has used: Somehow Father Fredo overheard our discussion in Hanes' room (how that was possible is beyond me, since the room is pretty much sound-proof while the priest himself wasn't supposed to be at the chapel at the time, but I am getting ahead of myself)."
    "Then he asked Hanes after our deal."
    "Then they got into a row, again, somehow."
    "	Now contrary to his normal personality, Hanes swore to the priest, practically guaranteeing the non-blasphemous and non-sinful nature of what we are doing, so we can continue to do what we're doing."
    "	To my sleep-addled understanding, that's what happened."
    H" W-well, you know Father Fredo might be a bit o-old-fashioned. B-but he's not un-unreasonable."
    "Hanes is, of course, being optimistic. According to him, this is as good a time as any for us to start operating in the light rather than the dark."
    A" Hold on a second!"
    A" That being the case... why in the Creator's name are we even talking about it like little sneaks in the forest at this time of day?"
