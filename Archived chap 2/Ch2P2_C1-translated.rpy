    A" It's actually rather simple. The twist moment of the wheel, generated as we spin it, helps to change the direction of the forces affecting it."

    A" Let's make it this way. Imagine the wheel as a clock with four positions: Twelve, three, six and nine o'clock."
    A" When it lies immobile, the force at the twelve-o'clock point will cause it to, well, lie horizontally like you normally see. "
    A" Now when you spin it clockwise like so, the twelve o'clock point would move to what was previously the three o'clock point before that gravitational force could act. "
    A" The gravitational pull remains, though, and pushes the previous three o'clock point forward, and the nine o'clock back. At the same time, the gravity force at point twelve and six remains zero."
    A" In other words, instead of falling flat on its face, the wheel would fall flat... on its side. Makes sense? Yes? Next question!"
    "Yeah, let's do that. Let's not waste time trying to explain further to Hanes: he's not going to get it from the look of it no matter how hard I try."
    "Azzurra, I'll explain this again to you later."
