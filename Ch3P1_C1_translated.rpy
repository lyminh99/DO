    A" Hey Azzurra. What's the matter? Travel sickness?"

#Azzurra (ngó lơ): 
    Az" ………"
    A" Hey, Azu! City to Azzurra! Hello?"

    Az" Eh? Ah! You're... saying something, Ana? P-pardon me!"
    A" Look."
    A" Azzurra."
    A" I..."
    A" well, I know it's not easy for you to come here, but that doesn't..."
    A" well, that shouldn't mean carrying that gloomy face all the way, should it? That isn't good for you, y'know?"

    Az" Actually... it's not that I'm gloomy."
    Az" It's the flowers."

    Az" Don't you smell it? It's all over the place!"

    "Azzurra takes a huge breath. It looks to me as if she'd think that such amazing aroma were a limited resource and would perish in a heartbeat."
    "Now that reminds me. That aroma wasn't there the last time I came along."
    "It is a fragrance so memorable, yet so delicate – so close yet so far, and stimulates the senses in the same breath as the wet grass."
    "The aroma of curiosity and dreams and childlike aspiration."

    P" Spring's when it blooms, and is quite a familiar thing to those who'd visit graves at the time. But then somehow for a few years now someone managed to make them bloom all years long."

    P" And that brings us back to the present: Nice fragrance, no?"

    "That it is, Azzurra. That it is."
    "Wait, hold on."
    "Didn't Dad say someone is making them bloom all years long? But isn't this place –"

    Az" But... Uncle? Who could have grown it here? And make it grow all year long too! That's really something, right?"
    show Azu P57 at center
    Az" Why haven't they brought it back to the City? I'm sure that'll sell like hot cakes!"

    H" Aurora members – or sympathizers. Those who caused Mane cruentum. Forsaken by the Creator, and by all His children."
    "Hanes' voice, from absolutely nowhere, sounds so strangely cold and vindictive. And strangely, free from stuttering."

    H" Years ago they were the enemy. Broken and vanquished and punished for their sin against the Creator, they were left here – away from His light and mercy, never to return."

    H" Anatolio. Azzurra. Y-you see. F-Father Fredo himself has n-never quite been to t-these places. "
    H" Y-yet they're always in his t-thoughts. I-I wonder if he h-has p-plans of his own, sending us to do this, d-don't you think?"
    H" I b-bet he n-never thought they are able to male things s-such as this."

    Az" But Hanes? Have you ever thought that might be a bit too harsh on them?"
    show Azu P42 at center
    Az" True, what they do wasn't right. But then again, isn't it innately evil to be curious? We aren't going to learn anything new without curiosity!"
    show Azu P39 at center   
    Az" I say they deserve sympathy for the wonders they've been able to make, not scorn! Isn't it too extreme to burn books and deny all that they've discovered?

    Az" Like what we-"
    A" Shush!"
    "I am, miraculously, able to shut down Azzurra's storm of emotions before any permanent harm is done. Don't get me wrong: I'm rather in agreement with Azzurra, but exposing our little secrets before the proud-and-pious Mr. Pietro? Bad idea, pal. Really bad idea."
    "As for Hanes? He's wised up enough to keep his thoughts to himself."
    "The air about us has suddenly condensed – I can cut it with a knife. Not even I can say anything to help with that."
    "In the meantime, the fragrance is closing on us – stronger and infinitely more suffocating."
    "Certain things, it seems to me, is only beautiful and admirable when felt from afar."
    "A good while has passed before we arrive at the cemetery. A good, long while."
