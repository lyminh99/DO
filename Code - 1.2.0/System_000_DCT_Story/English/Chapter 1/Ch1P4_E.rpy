    The De'Rovere mansion is doubtlessly the largest complex in the city, not counting churches, cathedrals and barracks. It is surrounded by a vast garden, punctuated by tall oaks and fountains and statues and pillars in between the four trimmed hedges. A veritable network of marble paths winds around the many buildings and pavilions and towers within. A fence of steel bars a dozen feet tall rises above the main gate, tipped with elongated spear heads, like a row of elite guards watching over the entrance decorated with eagle reliefs.The front side of the door – indeed the only place whose top isn't covered with spear tips – is etched with a huge relief of an old oak. Without even looking inside, the layer of gold gilded upon the fences alone stands testament to the wealth of the dwellers within. Beyond, well and truly, a classy thief's wildest dreams.

    nvlDC"The De'Rovere household has long been the target of rumors and slanders. As is expected of a family whose history goes long back and whose stature dwarfs everyone else's. Not even counting their possessions on their home turf, almost everything in the South side of the city has their hands on them, more or less. The Central Guildhouse and the Northern Guildhouse (colloquially referred to as the Central De'Rovere and the North De'Rovere Houses) are the largest of their kind, while the two De'Rovere bridges have been the cornerstone of trade and business in the city for a long, long while.They are everywhere; so it is said, so it is true. And that is not even counting their patriarch Duke Giovanni and his clout in the Church. They say the downright absurd donations he made building places of worship – a continuation of a family tradition over several generations – is merely the tip of the iceberg.

    "It seems only now does she arrive home."
    "Why have I been forced to wait here like this? I should have just let the paper fly and go loiter somewhere more worth my time."
    "Obviously she is trying to play me for all I'm worth again. She was grinning on that carriage just now."
    "Speaking of the carriage. It was speeding back then – now it's just crawling along."
    "I shouldn't have come here. I really shouldn't have."
    "The horses neigh as the rein loosened. "

    E" Greetings, Ana! Must have been tiring, walking all the way like that. Why doesn't Ana enter with me?"

    "The carriage ground to a halt, and from within Elena stepped down, one step at a time."

    A" Enough is enough. Stop pretending, will you?"

    "I clear my throat and point at the piece of paper Elena still holds."

    A" Give it back."

    show Azu Ele P004 at center

    E" Certainly. But Ana has to enter with Elena."
    A" Why must I?"
    E" Well then, Elena will go alone. Best of luck; and Elena will be seeing Ana soon."

    "Then, shooting a glare at me, she begins stepping through the open gateway."
    "The two men are also taking measured steps through the gate. But then Elena halts her steps for a bit, shooting yet another glance at me."
    "What should I do?"
    "“Do I even have a choice in the first place?” I tell myself."

    A" Fine"

    show Azu Ele P010 at center

    E" Apologies, Ana. Maybe another day?"
    A" Wait, what?"

    "I see Elena looking towards the carriage appearing in the distance, from the crossroad."
    "At that distance, you probably can't tell unless you've already known what it is. Or what it means."

    A"……"
    E" Ana should go"

    "Looking at Elena, I can tell who is sitting within that carriage."
    "The Count de Rovere himself."
    "Even now, I am frightened of him still."
    "The last time he saw me, he looked me from top to toe with those eyes you'd see on the faces of soldiers marching to war ready to slash, burn and slaughter. "
    "Elena was there to save me that time, but then she did “get into trouble” that time. Scolded? Beaten? Or worse?"
    "If he is to find me outside his place this time... well, I'd fear for my life. That's a child's impression for you. It will haunt you until the day you're six feet under."

    A" Hey… Elena"
    E" ……"


    "Her turn to say absolutely nothing. All I can hear is the sound of metal pivots grinding."
    "The great gate has closed before me, hiding behind it all that lies within."

    A" I should be off too."

    "Yes, that sounds about the wisest thing I can do right now."

    A" Eh?"

    "What is it this time?"

    A" Who?"

    "A paper aeroplane has just landed next to my foot."
    "It seems to have been launched from within the mansion, although the distance does require some suspension of disbelief."
    "But then, who cares? I unfolded the paper craft."

    " There is a poem on the opposite side of the sheet."
    " “Played for a fool again,” I murmur, fold the letter and keep it on my person."
    "Just in time before the carriage's wheels rolling on cobblestone ground drowns out the cello music from the mansion next door."
