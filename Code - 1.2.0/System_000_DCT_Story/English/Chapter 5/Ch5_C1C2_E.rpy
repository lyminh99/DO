    "I make up my mind. I will tell the truth... half of it, at any rate. There are, after all, such a thing as inevitable 'white half truths'. Between compromising Azzurra's safety and a harmless lie, I will have to go with the latter."
    A" Plan's that I'm going for a trip to the outskirt."
    "Elena stops for a brief moment, and then bursts out laughing."
    A" What's so funny, Elena?"

    E" Elena apologizes, but that is just too funny!"
    "I conceal my inner joy, and make an annoyed face."
    A" Very amusing, Elena. Just very amusing."
    "This is, after all, in-character for me. Right, right?"
    E" Of course it is! Ana can go whenever Ana likes! Ana's parents, Elena's sire, and the Church most holy and pious, who would stop Ana?"
    "Oh. Right. I didn't think this through, did I? Quickly, I must make something up, or else!"
    A" Well, uh... actually, I intend to go a bit further than that."
    E" A bit?"
    A" Up North. It's a bit farther than usual."
    "Elena widens her eyes at me."

    E" Ana is not jesting, is he?"
    A" Do I look like I am jesting?"
    "My head, I swear, is spinning, and my forehead is drenched with sweat. That is the first sentence to spring to my addled brain."
    E" But what for? Elena has a right to know, as part of the aristocracy..."
    "Elena looks at me without a blink. She really wants to leave me no wriggling space, eh?"
    A" Ah well."
    "She knows too well I have no effective counter to that."
    "Though I'm not going to give up without a fight, my dear Elena."
    A" I'll tell, sure. On one condition."
    E" Which is?"
    A" Tell nobody about it."
    E".."

    E" Hmm."
    "Elena clutches her mouth and looks like she's going to give me the shoulder-bump of a lifetime. She might have actually done that, had we not been on a busy street."
    E" Depends on what Ana says..."
    "Wait a second. What are the odds Elena is thinking I have something embarrassing I want to hide? Hey, that might actually be the break I'm looking for!"
    A" Then just don't laugh at it! Alright?"
    E" Ana shall speak, and Elena... shall judge."
    "Breathe in. Breathe out. In. Out."
    A" I... wish to ride along the Lucina until I can't go any further!"
    A" You know the legends, right? If a young man who haven't come of age would ride along the river, then maybe... Maybe! St. Lucina Herself would apparate and give him a wish..."
    "Just according to plan, Elena bursts out laughing again, even louder than before. I make another annoyed face, and it works."
    "I win this one, my dear Elena."
    A" I told you-"

    E" Mmm. Well, Elena laughs, that she did, but she understands, too."
    A" I don't see any understanding in that!"
    "Elena places her soft hand on my shoulder."
    E" Would Ana accept Elena's apology?"
    A" I... guess. Well, only if you don't tell anyone about it!"
    E" But of course. Elena understands! Elena can even help Ana more than that!"
    "Then she turns around, and gestures at her servants."
    E" Elena would require a good horse from Father's stable for Master Pietro here. Would you provide?"

    NDO"  Your will be done, Ma'am!"

    "Wait, what? What is she planning?"
    A" Elena, you don't have t-"

    E" Oh, and Elena almost forgot. Please do not bring the steed however good to Master Pietro's place. That would be bad!"
    "She turns around, and winks at me."
    E" Indeed it would, wouldn't it? Elena can take a good horse to whichever place Ana specifies. Don't be afraid, Elena does this for Ana!"
    "I scratch my head. Now what am I supposed to do with that offer?"
    A" T-to the lake it is."
    "First thing on my mind. Probably for the best."
    "Elena claps her hands, and the servants bow."
    E" Then it is decided. Do as Master Pietro told you to."
    A" W-wait just a moment there!"
    E" What's the matter, Ana?"
    A" Eh, well... no, I mean... wouldn't that be a bother? A bother, it is! To you, and to me! Y'know..."
    E" Bother? Not at all, Elena thinks. Ana is just being overly anxious."
    A" No, w-what I mean is... it wouldn't be good for you, would it? The bridge's just been reopened, and it's been tense all over, and I don't think it would be good seeing a De'Rovere walk around these parts more than she has to! Am I not right?"
    "Now that's not actually a false argument. Elena is already making an eyesore out of herself in our part of town. She stands out far too much, and at a time none too good."
    E" Oh, that? There's nothing wrong with that. Elena has so many plans and contingencies. And many a good man to carry them out. Elena is not meant to fail."
    "She pats her own chest proudly."
    E" That, and..."
    "Just in a second, just in a second, Elena's expression... changed."
    E" Preparing stuff for someone, well, Elena likes doing that."
    "She turns around, though her smile lingers on in my eyes:"
    E" At any rate, Elena will be following קוֹמֶדִיָה till the last moment..."
    "And so, just in a blink of an eye, Elena the nemesis of mine has completely turned into my redeemer. Just so simply."
    "	Yet her interference makes me even more worried. And why wouldn't I be worried? I've never quite truly understood her, after all those years..."

    nvlDC"\n I breathe in a lung full of fresh, cool air."
    nvlDC"\n The sun has yet to raise. The air here, fresh and clear, makes me think clearer and soothes my mind."
    nvlDC"\n The lake has never stopped being so primal to my eyes, untouched by man. The clutches of city life has never truly reached this part."
    nvlDC"\n The lake, you see, doesn't need to know of the Festival, nor does it need the Festival, period. After all, it is an embodiment of the Creator's boundless patience and tolerance – the aspect that, according to Father Fredo, just is and therefore demands no worship."
    nvlDC"\n He also said, once, that a child and a man grown will see the lake differently. Perhaps I will understand how, too, after it has ended."
    nvlDC"\n And – my hands ball into fists – I will go to the Festival with Azzurra. That's going to happen. That's what I think, pacing about waiting for Elena."
    nvlDC"\n Should I doubt Elena's goodwill? Well, on one hand long before Azzurra entered our lives I've known Elena. If I remember correctly."
    nvlDC"\n On the other hand, Elena's ill will towards Azzurra (if any) I'd guessed before. I'd Elena's only friend until then, hadn't I?"
    nvlDC"\n What are the odds Elena has already seen through my intention, and is planning a gambit of her own?"
    nvlDC"\n And then I hear the sound of footsteps and the clopping hooves of a fine horse. The lake's silence, as it happened, has been shattered."
    nvlDC"\n Two men appear, wearing tabards bearing the De'Rovere heraldry. They've got a horse behind them, too!"
    nvlDC"\n Not a war horse clad in mail chamfron and peytrel, no, but a chestnut pony just fit for my build, already saddled and reined."
    nvlDC"\n The first guardsman walks briskly towards me, wipes his forehead, and bows respectfully."

    nvl clear

    CV1"  Messer Pietro, ser! Our apologies for our lateness."

    "Then his comrade steps forth."

    CV2" Choosing the right horse according to the Lady's design took longer than we expected, ser! We beg your pardon!"

    "I scratch my head for the nth time in the last few days. What should I say? This is not the kind of respect and deference I expect, much less deserve!"
    A" T-that's plenty enough. Thanks!"
    "The guards say nothing more, but hang around just enough to help me up the saddle. I tremble all the way: I've ridden a horse before, true, but not half as long as the trip I'm supposed to be embarking on! I've never thought I'd have to do something like so before... well, before all this mess."
    "No, this is no time to doubt. I have to do this."
    "Only when I've been firmly seated do the men step aside."
    A" Oh, and one more thing. Where should I return you the ride?"

    CV1"  We'll be waiting for you here in the afternoon. We ask that you return before dark, because any later and all of us, Her Ladyship included, shall be in trouble..."

    "That chills me to the bones. Something tells me it wouldn't be good to wave this adventure in the Duke's face any time soon..."
    A" Will do, gentlemen. Off I go!"
    "Then I take the horse-whip I was given, and there I go."

    nvlDC"\n It is, all in all, not at all an easy journey."
    nvlDC"\n Finding the way has been easier than I thought. Even without Mr. Attenborough's map, Azzurra's 'aunt' and 'uncle' did say they live on the edge of the furthest village to the North where the Church still holds sway."
    nvlDC"\n There's only one path that-a-way. Not paved, nor meticulously kept, but still rather lacking in bumps and molehills."
    nvlDC"\n I keep my eyes and wits about me. The roads have been safe these days, but banditry is not completely unheard of."
    nvlDC"\n Some were committed by your everyday brigands and lowlives. Others, well, they say it's those apostates who did that – because the targets were Church-sanctioned caravans. Officially, anyway."
    nvlDC"\n I can't help but silently thank Elena in absentia for the horse. He's what you can call a workhorse: small enough, yet boasting the kind of stamina you'd expect from a mail-clad warhorse carrying armored knights. Enough, at least, to outrun any bandit I may ever encounter."
    nvlDC"\n But hey, let's not jinx myself, alright?"
    nvlDC"\n On my right and left, there is nothing but an open plain as far as the eyes can see. The further north, the fewer crops and the more sand, pebbles and shrubs."
    nvlDC"\n There are thin curtains of woodlands here and there. Scary stuff, to my eyes. There may or may not be bandits, or wild beasts, or both, in hiding..."
    nvlDC"\n It is a bit surprising, at the end of the day, that I did not encounter anything life-threatening. Thank the Creator, or my ancestors, or both, for small favors."
    nvlDC"\n They don't, and can't, help much with my tiredness and sorrow, though."
    nvlDC"\n From then all the way to the destination, I do nothing but follow the map. Bit of a bore, relieved only a bit by the hooves and the wind and the cicadas."

    nvlDC"\n Now the sun has peaked. It must have taken my ride some four to five hours – in part due to getting lost in a thin wood for quite a while. But there Azzurra's new place is, and there I am."
    nvlDC"\n Now it's a house both easy and hard to find. Easy, as it is in the middle of an open field. It's rather large and neat-looking, with bright red tiles, stout oak windows and doors, and a white-yellow layer paint that has been peeled off here or there."
    nvlDC"\n As my luck (or lack thereof) would have it, the whole place is hidden from sight of the main road by a curtain of old trees. Took me and the poor dear  a bumpy ride along a dirt path to get there. And me, silly me, thought it would be a good idea to look for a shortcut..."
    nvlDC"\n It works out about as well as running into a desert without supplies. It's all I could hope for that the horse didn't collapse on me, or stumble on a wild root or something."
    nvlDC"\n But now I'm here, and that's all that matters."
    nvlDC"\n I quickly dismount, then go about looking for a place to tie the poor dear to. I take a deep breath, and take in as much of the fresh air as I can. The warm sunlight shines on my sweat-drenched face."
    nvlDC"\n What a ride. Not sure if I'd be willing to embark on such a journey till the end of my life."
    nvlDC"\n But then, as I said: I have work to do. Work I have to get done."
    nvlDC"\n Let's get Azzurra out of here, and fast!"
    nvlDC"\n Then I run towards the house. My hands are tucked in my jacket pocket: There a bronze key awaits along with a crumpled piece of note."
