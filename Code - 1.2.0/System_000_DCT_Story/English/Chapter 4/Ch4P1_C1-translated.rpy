    A" We go find Hanes."
    "I said, as if that's the surest thing I can come up with on the spot."
    "Let's be honest: that number ten has been clinging to my head and would not let go. And I need someone who knows and is willing to shed some light on the coincidence."
    "Hanes wouldn't necessarily have known more than I do then, being a kid himself. But he might as well do now, being an initiate and a Graced no less. Failing that, there's always the chance Father Fredo would have told him at some point."
    "In any case, he's about the most trustworthy soul I can ask on this matter."
    "Now, it's no longer that easy to find Hanes any more, but I deserve some brownie points for trying."
    "Bad comes to worse I'll just scream in his ears."

    A" In fact, we can try looking for him in the streets or something. Hanes goes around on Church errands often, doesn't he?"
    "It isn't exactly courteous or classy to interrupt his official Church business, but that's all I can come up with."
