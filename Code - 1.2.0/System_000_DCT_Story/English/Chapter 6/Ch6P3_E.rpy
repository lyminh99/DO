    "How can I describe the atmosphere around the altar? Let's go with “condensed.”"
    "Two bishops in colorful robes chanting the scripture."
    "A choir split down the middle, each taking up a flank – been singing and chanting since early morning, too!"
    "From above, the statue of the Creator's Court gazes upon us, like mercy and vindication rolled into one (though that's partly to the sculptor's credit)."
    "To the lot of us who are to kneel down in the very middle, time has stopped."
    "My feet tremble with every step."
    "Theologians (by which I mean 'Father Fredo') say this moment, this very moment, is when the divine and mortal worlds become close as one."
    "Piety and impious thoughts alike will be accordingly infinitely magnified. Those whose hearts are impure would burn to ash as they approach the altar."
    "At least, that's what he said when I asked him a few weeks ago."
    "“Well, I've never seen that happen over the last seventy years of my life,” he's also said that."
    "That reassurance is hardly helpful to an Anatolio trying his darnedest to keep all emotions good and bad under control under that sun, in that air thick with sermons and incense."
    "We are among the last to perform the ceremony. That, too, is not at all reassuring. The bishops in their seemingly infinite fervor are still as solemn as they ever are."

    " I narrow my eyes. Not sure what he means, though that seems... positive at the very least."

    MS" Let us continue. As I said, and Azzurra Ines. Up the platform you go."
    MS" Kneel!"

    " The last adults-to-be, left to right, one after the other, prostrate before the altar."
    "The two bishops wheel to our flanks. One begin walking down our front, the other down our back. "
    "One wields the holy scripture, the other a steel staff. The one places the book upon our forehead, the other pats the staff on our shoulder."
    "I am closer to the one wielding the staff. "
    "The pat of cold iron doesn't hurt as much as I thought, though I still kinda sorta lost my balance just a little – more due to being startled than the actual impact."
    "And then when the book comes..."

    "What is happening here?"
    "I want to scream."
    "No, I will scream!"
    "But then the surrounding shakes and tremble."
    "Like old paint cracking and peeling, a patch of black melts away. In its place, a blinding spot of gold and orange appears: A blinding sun.    "

    C0" Anatolio Pietro, I suppose."
    A" Wh-who's there?"
    C0" Stay calm. I wish not to harm you."

    " The sun widens and thickens, until the whole space around me has seen the light swallowing all shadow."

    A" W-who are you? What are you?"
    C0" I am that which is both myself and not. I am both here and not. I exist at the same time I do not."

    " Curiosity overwhelms fear and horror in me."

    A" S-so how may I address you?"
    C0" Let's settle with the name my devotees gave me."
    C0"  Meyr."
    A" Meyr? The Creator? The embodiment of Sun and Moon and Earth and everything in between? The Almighty?"
    C0" … Yes. That being... is me, at the same time it is not. But as humans are comfortable more with masks than essence, that would do."

    " My feet gives way. I collapse on my knee on what appears like the ground. "
    "I'm not sure what is chief within me right now, fear or honor in the audience of the Creator Himself of all beings!"

    A" F-f-forgive me, Y-your Holiness! H-how may I-I-I- this humble servant, be of-of-of service?"
    
    "The voice booms around me at the same time it rings in my brain."
    
    C0" I want – no, I hope you would take care."
    C0" Everything is just beginning."
    C0" I fear you are seeking an answer that is not meant to be."
    C0"  Yet in your free will and curiosity you will seek it regardless, and come close to it, and will even find one way or another it if you are resourceful enough... which you are."
    C0" I can only advise you to take care and prepare accordingly. This won't be the last you shall be in my audience."
    A" Lord Creator, your Holiness, I... I shall!"
    C0" Remember this: There is no right answer. There is only a suitable one. Remember this."

    " I would have asked more – and truly want to – had the ethereal space around me not collapsed faster than I can open my mouth."
    "I find myself before the altar."
    "The two bishops are still chanting."

    MS" … The Divine shalt watch over your children, protect them for their innocence and punish them for their sin. Now they walk in the sun, as men and women grown, and..."

    " I look up at the great statue."
    " My eyes are blurry, but I am willing to swear in this most holy place, that the icon of the Creator in the middle has just twinkled once before my eyes."

    "That strange thing in the ceremony isn't the only thing to occupy me."
    "I decide not to tell anyone, not even Azzurra, much less the clergy, what I saw. What I heard. What I got from it all"
    "Call it the remaining self-preservation instinct of a child. "
    "Suffice to say a troublemaker suddenly getting an audience with the Creator of all figures? Well, you don't need to be a theologian to know, this is big. Too big."
    "I don't care for and don't want to know what would happen to our society if I let this slip."
    "There's also that possibility I was hallucinating. I was stressed then, and tired, and emotionally drained."
    "This incident I shall bring with me to my grave."
    "Having said that..."
    "My troubling days have not yet ended. Far from it."

    " As I walk, a question lingers still in my mind: Why did I say yes to Mr. Attenborough again?"
    "Azzurra is safe and so am I. Everything seems fine. Life will be back to normal."
    "Well, except for Hanes, that is."
    "Even now I don't know how I should think about him or his end."
    "Once upon a time, he was my friend. Our friend. Does he deserve this sort of demise? Perhaps, but then if we are to condemn him, what about us, then? We were his friends, we could have intervened... and didn't."
    "But that's all I can do about him now: think, and like plain thoughts ever helped anything. Should I not divert all that effort to live, and live well at that?"
    "Which, incidentally, makes seeing Mr. Attenborough rather redundant."
    "Speaking of the man, he's waiting for me under a large tree. "
    "This time his attire consists of nothing but the color black: Black tunic, black pants and black cloak. Like one of those spies in a work of thriller fiction."

    "I bend my head."

    A"  Sir."

    " It's not too surprising that he knows, at this point. The question is more like, what am I to say to that? "

    show Azu Paul P2 at center

    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa"  Plus, I... we have reasons to keep Hanes safe. We failed."
    A" No way... does that mean..."
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" We have to suspect the Church did the deed. For reasons only they know."
    A" C-could it be that..."

    A" I see. They want Aurora to catch Azzurra or at least make sure she doesn't attend the ceremony. "
    A" This is what Hanes has to do, and... and he failed. Is this his punishment?"
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" Oh no. The Church isn't so low as to off someone for failing a task. I reckon there must be something else in this."
    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa"  Perhaps he knows something he should not. Or he's been trying to use the Church to his own ends."

    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa"  If you catch my drift."

    " That is certainly possible. Given what Hanes has shown? Perhaps he'd thought the Church is but a tool to be used for ultimate power."

    A" Hanes... you... are an idiot."
    
    show Azu Paul P0 at center

    Pa" You still can't think him an enemy."

    "And how I'm standing right here, right now."

    Pa" We're flattered, but ours is only a small part in all things."

    A" But then from the start I've been a normal fellow from a normal family. "
    A" What I have been doing all my life has been, well... eating, sleeping, playing, sketching things, and conducting silly experiments that were like child's play to you."
    A" You might think me brave, sir... but actually I'm not. Not at all."
    A" Joining you, well... I'm not sure if I have what it takes."

    Pa" Well, to that I'll give you one word. Just one: “Agnostikos”."
    A"  “Agnostikos”?"
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" “Unknowable”. A dead word, in a dead language from a dead civilization. Something deemed impossible to truly discover or figure out."
    A" But that conflicts with what Aurora is, doesn't it? Don't you exist to learn all that there is to learn?"

    Pa" There's a possibility that something out there in this universe exists just as the Church describes it, and we cannot discount that very real possibility. "

    Pa" The only problem is you cannot use the scientific method – yet, hopefully – to truly find out whether the truth is one way or the other."
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" We put such matters into the “unknowable” basket. Impossible to prove or disprove. Maybe it's better that way."
    A" So why fight the Church?"
    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa" Because that which they claim to be the truth is plain wrong. We could even live with such falsehood, if they hadn't been profiting from it."

    Pa" Ah, I'm probably not the best to ask, out there. If you care to join? You'll be schooled in these matters and probably a lot more by the masters until all your questions have been well answered."
    A" Aren't you a master yourself, sir?"
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" Me? Hah, I wish. Compare to the prodigies I mentioned? I'm just a third-rate scholar, "

    Pa" who happens to do politics and maneuvering a bit better than he does research. Fortunately there's some use for that skill somewhere..."

    " Options flash in my head, and at once I don't quite know what is best. Finally, I settle for the best possible choice at once: postponement."

    A" Then how should I contact you again, sir?"
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" Say, I'll give you... five days. I'll be waiting here for you, at this exact spot, after the moon rises. "
    Pa"If you still aren't here by midnight, I'll take it that you have refused, and won't bother your new life any further. Deal?"

    " I nod, and look him in the eyes."

    A" Deal."
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" Then it's decided. Hopefully you'll make the best choice in five days' time."

    nvlDC"Time slows to a crawl as the weekend approaches."
    nvlDC"\n Now the streets are rather busy these days, filled with lots and lots of people our own age. They take to the streets, to work, to the market and even to the tavern for 'real' drinks. Adults do adult stuff, that's the mindset."
    nvlDC"\n Perhaps I'm the only in this newly-of-age batch to behave as I do: stay at home, and keep myself to myself."
    nvlDC"\n I haven't spoken much to my parents, or spoken at any length with Azzurra. I don't even want to leave the safety of my room, much less go anywhere."
    nvlDC"\n I'd like keep the door close, and just think."
    nvlDC"\n About the events that have transpired."
    nvlDC"\n About what Azzurra and I have gained and lost."
    nvlDC"\n And most importantly? About what we, no, I should do now."
    nvlDC"\n At the end of the day, my survival instinct forces me to meld into the crowd. At any rate Azzurra and I were the topic of much gossip: two abnormal kids who took the ceremony under abnormal circumstances, who may or may not have ties with other abnormal folks. To say nothing about Hanes."
    nvlDC"\n Yes, Hanes. Old friend, let's say you've left us a complicated heritage."
    nvlDC"\n His passing once again puts us in the spotlight. We were, after all, his best – only – friends,  and the last people he picked a fight with."
    nvlDC"\n Were life a detective novel, we'd be finding ourselves facing a stern-faced, twirly-stached detective armed with a monocle and a lifetime's supply of tobacco trying to pry the hypothetical truth out of us."
    nvlDC"\n But I'm sure that won't happen. It's bound to be soon forgotten."
    nvlDC"\n Because the Church keeps its silence on the matter, and maintains it that way."
    nvlDC"\n So if I am to mix into the crowd, everything will perhaps be alright."
    nvlDC"\n Certainly, I think to myself, that's the best way."
    nvlDC"\n Thinking so, I force myself to leave the house everyday."
    nvlDC"\n Looking for a new place to work. That's right. Work. Employment."
    nvlDC"\n Makes sense, right? I'm a grown man, and have well outgrown that job as a waiter in Mr. Ascenderos' tea shop."
    nvlDC"\n But then both my parents and I are well aware that bringing my gloomy face into any business at all, asking for the lowest of low jobs, they'd laugh at my face and show me the door. The back door."
    nvlDC"\n What I really do is to walk from one end of the City to the other and back."
    nvlDC"\n Walk. Just walk. Just walk as fast as I can, eyes planted on the cobblestone. I'm a busy man. Lots of things to do... to work for."
    nvlDC"\n I'm a very important man. Important and busy, that's right. Think that to myself, and maybe it will become true, who knows?"
    nvlDC"\n But then today I stop before Azzurra's doors once again."
    nvlDC"\n Deep inside I feel like punching the cowardly Anatolio that is ruling me these days."
    nvlDC"\n How could I have not spoken to Azzurra for so long?"
    nvlDC"\n But of course, Anatolio the Coward voices his defense: I should not, and cannot, just meet Azzurra every day, if I don't want society's gossip to go on."
    nvlDC"\n In any case, Azzurra's place these days are locked most of the time. Is Azzurra doing exactly what I am doing? Trying to meld into the crowd, making like a social chameleon?"
    nvlDC"\n Not today."
    nvlDC"\n The front door is unlocked: as if she's inviting me to enter."
    nvlDC"\n Should I? Of course!"
