    "Morning of the Day. Anatolio, reporting in."
    "All... is not well."

    nvlDC"If someone had told me two week ago that there would be a time my parents' shouting would sound so surreal, I would have laughed him off."
    nvlDC"\n And now, here I am, looking at and listening to everything as if they were all otherworldly. Like I've gone to a new world with new worries and challenges, and forced now to look back at the world I have left, and those still stuck in it."
    nvlDC"\n But to focus on the positive: The streets are so beautiful today. So beautiful as to be contradictory to how I am feeling. Not positive at all, now to think about it."
    nvlDC"\n The festival shall take place at the central piazza. Every road leading there has been elegantly decorated: flowers and banners and the sign of the Holy Light."
    nvlDC"\n They've put up a series of great arches along the main street. Not a scrap of litter anywhere, nor a single open shop. Every eyes are supposed to be on a large stage at the center of the piazza, under which a huge altar has been erected under the great statue of the Creator's Court."
    nvlDC"\n The Creator Meyr stands in the middle of the statue, his great blade pointing down at the altar. Looks like I shall be standing right about there. He shall be the judge as to whether I am deserving of being human or not."
    nvlDC"\n To think of it, one of the most sacred moment in a person's life is supposed to be the scariest. Being a grown and accepted citizen, well, that's meant to be a privilege, not a right, and can be revoked if you do not live up to it."
    nvlDC"\n But then it's not all gloomy and stiff-necked, you see."
    nvlDC"\n The shops that have closed? Well, that's because lots and lots of little tents have been put up around the altar. Ceremony for us and a grand fair for the rest: food and games and fun, and even tents where venerable fathers would take the time to debate the sacred scripture to the pious who would hear their theological thoughts."
    nvlDC"\n The aroma of sweets and pastries and flowers and perfumes and sacred candle... You've got to be there to know such atmosphere does exist in this boring mortal coil."
    nvlDC"\n Everyone can enter the piazza as they please, though the grand stage is barred to all until the moment. A dozen ceremonial Templars in mail and tabard and all the panoplies of war stand guard, still as a row of live-sized statues."
    nvlDC"\n For a while I stand before the grand stage. It's still rather early, but I'm still joined by some dozens my age: male and female, thin and pudgy, dwarvishly short to twiggily tall..."
    nvlDC"\n Once every so often one would nervously approach the guards and show their medals. “Come back later” was all they got. That's right, we're all too early."

    H" Oh, look what have we here! What an honor, Your Smartness."

    " I spin around. There stands Hanes, arms folded. Both himself and his two stick-wielding attendants are clad in garishly colorful clerical robes."
    " Now he mocks a bow in my general direction. Are my eyes deceiving me, or are Hanes' eyes even tinier today than it normally is?"
    A"  Hanes."

    " I toss him the most hateful glance I can muster."

    A" What do you want?"
    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" Nothing in particular, except for..."

    " Hanes turns his nose up."

    H" … a rare drama about to unfold..."

    " Hanes raises his hand to his eyes, mocking a navigator scanning the horizon for land in one of those seafaring dramas we saw as a kid."

    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" About to unfold, I sure hope. Seems like the main actress is missing! Talk about killjoy, heh!"
    A" You're testing my patience, Hanes."
    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" Oh, forgive me, Your Smartness. What has your humble servant do to earn your ire so?"

    " “Ire”? Understatement. Were this an empty open space? I would have tackled him to the ground and punch the snot out of him."

    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" Such silence from the main actor. Say something! The audience are leaving, boo!"
    A" If you have nothing important to say, leave. We have no business."
    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" Oh, not interested, you say? Need me no more? The old friend who's been through thick and thin? Your yes-man punching bag?"

    " My brain feels like imploding. I'm not sure, again, if I am to hate him or pity him, or – like I said – try to punch the snot out of him."
    "I sigh. Part of me still cannot see Hanes as an enemy... though by all means he is now a bigger threat to me than that illness ten years ago."
    "A pox. Pestilence."

    show Azu Hanes P3 at center
    H" Not even if I bring you a salvation for your dear Azu?"

    " Hanes makes a mocking bow."

    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" Your Grace, is that enough of a gift to land me in your favor? Or how else shall this humble servant degrade himself?"
    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H"  Just let me know!"

    "Right. Hanes wants to help me. And I am a giant man-eating, fire-breathing ant. Makes sense."
    "Yet my unconscious self jumps at the chance. I can only say one word."

    A" Speak."

    " Hanes glances at the great clock tower behind the piazza."

    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" Hour's still early. Azzurra isn't coming even if you wait. How about I treat you to a drink for old time's sake? What say you? Pal?"
    A" I'm going nowhere. Either speak, or leave."

    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" What's the matter? Not every day you get an invitation from an up-and-coming member of the clergy! It's not like you need someone of my ilk to help..."
    H" Oh wait, you do! More's the pity! What do you say, huh?"
    
    "Enough of this."
    "I turn away. And I would just walk out of it without a thought, if Hanes didn't tug me in the arm."

    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" Such hurry. To where, friend?"
    A" To where I won't have to see your face. Unless you have something to say."
    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" Well. Very well. Very well then."

    " Hanes wheels to my front. His smirk has never looked more irksome."

    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" Concerning Azzurra. Interested?"
    A"  …"
    A"  Bhahahahahaha!!!"
    A" This commoner must have heard wrong, venerable Father-in-training."

    " Hanes looks me in the eyes. Unfazed."

    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" Funny? Thought so. Probably you think, why should I do that?"
    A" Fool me once, fool me twice... I'm no idiot, Hanes."

    H" I have no need for that, Anatolio. If you recall, I'm winning this game."
    A" Too late."
    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" But of course, it's up to you. The Anatolio that I know, at least, wouldn't say no."

    " Mind games. Hanes has become adept at them. I haven't."
    "How am I supposed to respond to that"
    "No, let's think again. I shouldn't bother too much with whether I should trust Hanes again. Not going to do that ever again till they bury me six feet under."
    "Look at it this way. Can I use him somehow?"
    "“Use him”. Right. And I'm willing to bet my inheritance he's got ten ways to use me to every one of mine."

    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" So, what do you say? This shall be good, I assure you."
    A" Speak."

    " Hanes chuckles."

    H" That's the fellow I knew!"
    show Azu Hanes P2 at center
    H" Hear me out. You – we can help Azzurra. There's a good way. A great way, if you do as I say."
    A" Which is?"
    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" Here's the rule: If someone doesn't receive the invitation, that means the Creator's Court have not accepted them from the very beginning."
    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H"  But if someone is to make the final sacrifice for that person..."
    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" So, if someone about to undertake the ceremony would give up their own rights to humanity for the damned soul... "
    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H"  well, They would give the wretch a second chance."
    H" Apotheosis, 8:31. Line three through five. Just in case you don't memorize the holy scriptures."

    "I don't know which part of that rule has to do with the Creator being merciful and all that, but what do I know? After all, He works in mysterious ways."

    A" You're suggesting my humanity for Azzurra's."
    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" Precisely!"
    A" What do you have to gain from this?"
    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" Think for yourself – where would you go if you are no longer recognized as human? "
    H" I know just the right people who'd gladly welcome you as family. Comradeship in misery, that's what it is."

    " I feel my knees wobbling. Could it be that-"
    "Just then Hanes draws closer. Closer than I am comfortable with."

    A" You-"

    H" Rest assured, friend. Not too many knows of your dealing. Just me, and a few others."
    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" Others who, like me, think they can manipulate everyone else."
    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" Let's just say they underestimated me a tad."

    " So that is how it is."
    "At the end of the day, everyone, be it Azzurra, or myself, or Father Fredo... boils down to nothing but value in use to this wretch."
    "I don't know which is worse. Either he's always been like this, then I've been a fool trusting him."
    "Or he's just become like this over the last few... years? Months? Or even weeks? In which case I would be a terrible friend for letting him become as much."
    "Either way..."

    A" Hanes... you dastard."
    show Azu Hanes P3 at center
    H" Compliments, compliments, been getting them everywhere of late. Can't be dastardly enough if I want to get some power for myself..."
    
    "What have I got to say to that?"
    
    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" Well? What do you say?"

    " He glances up the great clock tower behind the piazza."

    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" Look at the time! Say, we've got like minutes on the clock. Make a choice if you will, or let Azzurra suffer if you won't. I can't do everything, you see.."
    
    "My brain rattles and clanks to life. It presents me, on the fly, with three options. Neither sound any better than the rest."
    "It urges me to choose one. "
    A" I..."
