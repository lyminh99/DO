    Pa" Hmm."
    A" Something wrong, sir?"
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" Yes... no, not that much. Just that this is not exactly what I've been after."
    A" Really? I've taken this document from that safe in that house?"
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" So you did. This does help me confirm some doubts I've been having. Not the biggest one, unfortunately."
    A" Is that... so?"

    " I try to keep my disappointment in check. Mr. Attenborough looks like he understands the sentiment however I try."

    A" I apologize, sir-"
    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa" Don't worry too much about it. You've saved Azzurra, and that's already a huge favor you've done for me. Not to mention..."

    " He slowly flips one page at a time."

    Pa" Quite a sensitive matter, that Church-approaches-Aurora-members thing. "

    Pa" Great tool in the right hand, if you get me. Not always do we have some corroborations handy."

    Pa" I still owe you some gratitude for that. "

    Pa" Now if there is some hypothetical change in the world in the days to come... your help shall not be forgotten."

    " If it sounds like a praise, is spoken like a praise, and probably intended to be a praise, then maybe I can take it as a praise. "
    "Yet I don't feel any less worries about it. It does have that veiled-threat undertone to my ears..."

    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa" But I must ask you: Did you find anything strange in that house that day? Anything out of the ordinary, or that worries you somehow?"

    " I rub my forehead. I was focusing so much on saving Azzurra and completing the task, and didn't quite pay enough attention to anything."
    "Well, except one thing..."

    A" I'm not sure if it counts, but Azzurra's tone was... odd that day. She spoke of things I'm not sure I understand."

    " Paul looks me in the eyes."

    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" For example?"
    A" Philosophical things. It feels like she's aged by a dozen years over just a couple weeks."

    " Mr. Attenborough's eyes still stare at me blinklessly. "
    "A scarily inexplicable interest is what I get: as if a kind of hunger demon had taken him over with the flick of a switch."

    Pa" I would be grateful for a little more detail..."

    Az" She talks of the universe. How our life is largely meaningless unless we use it to solve the great mysteries of the cosmos.."

    Pa" Is that so?"
    A" I've had to shake her out of it – persuade her that our lives has a purpose beyond what lies beyond the horizon."

    " Mr. Attenborough's brows furrow."

    Pa" I see. That sounds both right and... wrong."
    A" What is the matter, sir?"

    Pa" That altruistic science mindset does sound like the kind of person Hildegarde is, but not the person she shows."
    Pa " To most of our associates she is just this cut-and-dry evidence person, not a philosopher and even less of an altruist."

    Pa" What are the odds my good friend would share her true thoughts to someone she would keep just as a guinea pig?"
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" Where could she have gotten such changes from?"

    A" You mean... you don't think Azzurra came up with all that herself?"
    
    "I shake my head. Then your guess, Mr. Attenborough, are just as good as mine."

    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" I'll take this under advise. Seem like we've just answered one question only to find ourselves with a bigger one."
    
    "I admit, even with her confession in the forest under the rain, Azzurra's change was too quick and a bit on the incredible side,"
    
    A" What would you suggest I do, sir? About Azzurra..."
    Pa" At present? Nothing. You don't need to worry too much about her."
    A" But why? She is still threatened-"
    Pa" To most people I'd say 'you'll thank me when the time comes'. But I know you won't like hearing that."
    A"..."
    
    "I won't like it so much, my good gentleman, I would have punched you in the face had you said so."
    
    Pa" So I will tell you that Azzurra is being protected. By whom and how? That's a matter of utmost secrecy."
    A" And... Hanes? How should we handle him?"
    Pa" What about him?"
    A" We've had a... run-in with him. His true self. I doubt we'll ever be friends again from now on."
    
    "Paul claps his hands and nods sagaciously."

    Pa" I see. It's always an unpleasant thing, losing a friend like you did. Though not entirely without warning."
    A" Not without warning?"
    Pa" You know the common wisdom. Raise a child in hatred and spite and he will repay society with the same."
    
    "I am not sure if he meant those words as an accusation against me, yet I can't help thinking as much."
    "Have I been a good friend to Hanes?"
    "I've been asking myself that much – between worrying about my future with Azzurra (if all goes well) and worrying about the event that stands in our way tomorrow."
    "The answer is no."
    "The little things I didn't notice when it happened."
    "The tiniest disdain I shot him without a thought."
    "Even the malice I meant at the time."
    "Everything I threw at a Hanes who could not properly defend himself against a me who was simply superior to him in all things but the initiate's habit he wore."
    "They will likely haunt me till the rest of my days, even if I can find my own happiness with Azzurra."
    
    A" Can I still help him somehow?"
    Pa" I wouldn't bother trying. Your old friend Hanes has got a rather terminal case of megalomania. Thinks he knows all that there is to know about the Church and Aurora. In truth... he knows less than you do."
    Pa" There are forces at work you won't know until it hits you in the face.  "
    A" 'Forces'?"
    Pa" Let's say every organization in existence has a wealth of skeletons in their figurative closets that outsiders and newcomers aren't aware of.  "
    Pa" For the likes of the Church and to a lesser extent ourselves? That's not a few skeletons, but an entire cemetery."
    Pa" Hanes seems to take everyone for fools. That he's the only one with a brain. Silly, and rather pitiable."
    
    "He clicks his tongue, and drops a thin smirk."

    Pa" Think for yourself what this means."
    
    "He pats me on the shoulder."

    Pa" Now if you are truly worried about Azzurra, then behave as per normal tomorrow and cause no trouble. Otherwise you'd be breaking things rather than mending them."
    
    "He must have seen my woes by now, and therefore his words sounds like both a reassurance... and something of a warning."
    
    A" … I see."
    
    "It is difficult enough for a very burdened Anatolio Pietro to breathe out as much."
    "Burdened by guilt, and without much to bargain with."
    
    Pa" But rest assured: You are not unneeded, my friend."
