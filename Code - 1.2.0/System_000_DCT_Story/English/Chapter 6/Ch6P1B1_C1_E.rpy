    " Hardly have I finished my sentence when Mr. Attenborough's large hand falls upon my shoulder with an audible slap."

    Pa" Good. Good. Just as I expected of you."

    Pa" Then let's waste no time. Get in and hold on."

    " I nod, and do exactly as I am told."
    "With a loud neigh, the draft horse starts pulling our carriage along the road North."
    "When you go far enough North, what you get is this kind of cold. It hangs around in every leaf, howls through every gap in the wood, and chills you to the bone."
    "Not unlike that last time so many years ago, does it?"
    "This time around, there is neither time nor mood to smell the flower. "
    "Besides, we didn't even go that far: it seemed like minutes before we came to a stop, near a newly erected watch post with the City's banner on top of it."
    "I am about to ask how we were going to pass without questions, when Mr. Attenborough turns the carriage around, and takes a detour through a seemingly invisible road."
    "“Seemingly” is the keyword: where we are going, the wheels seem to have a hard time dodging all the unfriendly pebbles littered along the uneven earth."
    "I spend the next five minutes having my behind and shoulder mercilessly tortured. Is it any surprise I can't be gladder when we finally come to a stop, in the middle of nowhere as it is?"

    Pa" And here we are."

    " We are far enough that most of the tower's garrison wouldn't even bother to go looking, but for good measures (I think), Mr. Attenborough still chose not to put on any fire whatsoever."

    Pa" I hope you recall this place, no?"
    A"Certainly, sir."

    " This is not, to my understanding, that far from the site of our glorious project (except not quite). I'm willing to bet our little pipe runs across the land here, between the lake and that desolated village."

    Pa" Thought as much. Wouldn't be right if you'd forget this pump. Caused us lot quite a bit of issue, every one of us."

    Pa" To be honest, though... you did good, son. You did good."

    " I don't know if I'd ever know what he truly means by that. In fact, I'm still thinking as he takes me near a tree stump."
    "Rustle. Rustle. Rustle."
    "Now would you ever guess that! Underneath the grass there is a hidden entrance to a tunnel, well hidden by a clever camouflage."
    "Actually, scratch that. Something like this should exist. I just can't think such a world unknown to the normal everyday person would exist so close to the City."

    Pa" You first, gentleman."
    A" M-me? But-..."

    Pa" Now steel yourself. I assure you: There's no ghost or monster of any sort inside."

    " He chuckles as he points to the entrance."
    "Tell me what other choice have I at this point?"
    "Again I do as I am told. I expect a loud creak as is the wont for such hidden entrance. It never comes: the place is better-maintained than I would expect."
    "There's a ladder leading into the darkness below."
    "Am I stepping down into the abyss?"
    "You heard the man, Anatolio! Steel yourself, and just go!"
    "Clank."
    "Clank. Clank."
    "Clank. Clank. Clank"

    "Except that... perhaps not."

    A" This is..."

    Pa" Welcome to your new home, Mr. Pietro. Well, not quite home, actually."
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" But you'll be spending quite a lot of time here, if not by my order then out of your own accord."
    A" But what is this place?"

    Pa" Well, it is..."
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" It is whatever you make of it. Home, a study, a secret lab, a hiding place when things go pear-shaped... "
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" There's enough here to fulfill whatever purposes you'd like."
    A" So this will be my place?"
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" Not just yourself. "

    Pa" Let's say this is a common room for all Aurora member currently working in the City."

    Pa"  You'll be officially inducted next week, right here."
    A"  I... see."

    " I glance upon the shelf, the cupboard, the table and the two bunk beds on either side of the room."
    "So clean. So orderly. So well-maintained. By whose hands, I can only guess. Bottom line, this is quite a good place to stay if nothing else."

    Pa" See the doors? One leads to the city's waterworks. Good for a quick getaway. The other..."

    Pa" He's not going to do you harm. Follow your order, do what you need to do, and you'll get to meet him soon enough."

    " Suddenly my knees wobble. Guess why."

    A" I suppose he's our side, right?"

    " Paul nods."

    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" He built this secret room. He, and a certain Silvio Fredo. Thought you might have heard about him."
