    " Morning of the Day. Anatolio, reporting in."
    " All... is not well."
    " So, whatever that comes, shall come."
    " Here comes the Festival a-knocking, and needless to say? I'm all the less happy for it."
    " But today, just today, I can't let myself be consumed by this gloominess. "
    " If I look even remotely unhappy, the happy fellow with a family and a medal and an invitation, what would Azzurra think?"
    " My first order of business is to somehow get Azzurra out of the house. Easier said than done."

    Az" … I don't think so, Ana."
    A" What do you mean 'I don't think so'? You have to go today!"
    show Azu P52 at center
    Az" And for what? I don't have an invitation either way-"
    A" But you can't sit here either! You know me, right? Giving up without a fight is not in my dictionary!"
    show Azu P53 at center
    Az" Even so... wouldn't it be foolhardy jumping into a fight you cannot win?"
    A" Who tells you it's a fight we can't win?"
    show Azu P54 at center
    Az" …. Logic?"
    A" Alright, logic, Azzurra. Try using that to explain like everything that has happened so far."

    " Azzurra stares at the wooden flooring, and rubs her foot against it."

    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" It actually works out alright. Think about it, Anatolio, everything makes some sort of sense. "
    show Azu P52 at center
    Az" Only... well, we only find it illogical if we don't have the whole picture. Right?"
    A" Well, true, I'll give you that, but how are we supposed to know everything? Who knows? "
    A" What if there is something in this business both you and I haven't been aware of just yet?"

    " My hand quickly reach for my mouth. Just a little more, and I would have spilled the beans on what Mr. Attenborough said."
    "Fortunately. Azzurra doesn't look like she's paying attention to my oddity. She rubs her temple, and suddenly finds the window-sill all too mesmerizing."

    show Azu P42 at center
    Az"  …"
    A" Well? Finally seen the light? Then let's go for it!"
    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" Right, right, right. I'll go! But I'm not putting my dinner money on a miracle!"
    Az"You too, Anatolio. Let's not put so much hope in it. There aren't that many miracles to go around."
    
    " Azzurra. Cậu cũng vậy, Anatolio ạ. Đừng hy vọng quá nhiều. Phép màu không có nhiều như thế đâu."

    show Azu P53 at center
    Az" ... as otherwise, everything would have unraveled along an entirely different route."
    A" What's the objection again, Azzurra?"
    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" Oh, nothing. Nothing. Nothing to worry about!"

    " She looks me in the eyes and waves her hands."

    show Azu P39 at center
    Az" Now show yourself out! A lady's got to change!"

    " I found myself kicked out of the room before I can say 'yes' or 'no'."

    " Let us focus on the positive: The streets are so beautiful today. So beautiful as to be contradictory."
    "The festival shall take place at the central piazza. Every road leading there has been elegantly decorated: flowers and banners and the sign of the Holy Light."
    "They've put up a series of great arches along the main street. "
    "Not a scrap of litter anywhere, nor a single open shop. Every eyes are supposed to be on a large stage at the center of the piazza, under which a huge altar has been erected under the great statue of the Creator's Court."
    "The Creator Meyr stands in the middle of the statue, his great blade pointing down at the altar. Looks like I shall be standing right about there. He shall be the judge as to whether I am deserving of being human or not."
    "Azzurra looks up at the statue, then bends her neck and clasps her hands."

    A" Azu... mind if I ask something odd?"
    A" How much stock do you put on the deities?"
    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" Say wha-?"

    " Azzurra stares at me, then back to the statue. Then she clasps her hand, then rolls her fist, and clonk! I've been knocked on the forehead."

    A" Yeowch! What's that for?"

    " Azzurra mockingly dusts her fist."

    show Azu P39 at center
    Az" That's what you get for a strange question!"
    A" Ouch... is curiosity a crime these days?"

    " Azzurra presses her fist against my face, then withdraws it. Now there is this incredibly serious look on her face... like someone about to make a most sacred oath."

    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" I do. But not like others."
    show Azu P53 at center
    Az" I've got this feeling... that there's a special string binding me to the Creator. I can't quite explain how, but... I feel like I am guided. "
    show Azu P54 at center
    Az" To do something He means for me to. It's kind of like being Graced... just without all the bells and whistles."
    A"  Why would you think that?"
    show Azu P50 at center
    Az" Mmm... Long story."
    show Azu P42 at center
    Az" How about so: Think it a preternatural 'sense'. Which means it can be on-the-mark right or way-off wrong. Works?"
    A" In that case, all the more reason to believe that everything will be alright! "
    A" The Creator's Court shall not abandon a lovable girl who have done nothing but show her intense faith!"

    " I'm not sure how serious I meant those words to be, though I do make an attempt to look as jovial as I humanly can. Yet Azzurra's face remains solemn still."

    show Azu P52 at center
    Az" Wish everything were that simple..."
    show Azu P53 at center
    Az" But alright, let's not worry ourselves, you said? Well... it is a once-every-decade festival..."

    " I swallow hard, just thinking of that once-every-decade part."

    nvlDC"To think of it, one of the most sacred moment in a person's life is supposed to be the scariest. Being a grown and accepted citizen, well, that's meant to be a privilege, not a right, and can be revoked if you do not live up to it."
    nvlDC"\n But then it's not all gloomy and stiff-necked, you see."
    nvlDC"\n The shops that have closed? Well, that's because lots and lots of little tents have been put up around the altar. Ceremony for us and a grand fair for the rest: food and games and fun, and even tents where venerable fathers would take the time to debate the sacred scripture to the pious who would hear their theological thoughts."
    nvlDC"\n The aroma of sweets and pastries and flowers and perfumes and sacred candle... You've got to be there to know such atmosphere does exist in this boring mortal coil."
    nvlDC"\n Everyone can enter the piazza as they please, though the grand stage is barred to all until the moment. A dozen ceremonial Templars in mail and tabard and all the panoplies of war stand guard, still as a row of live-sized statues."
    nvlDC"\n For a while we stand before the grand stage. It's still rather early, but I'm still joined by some dozens my age: male and female, thin and pudgy, dwarvishly short to twiggily tall..."
    nvlDC"\n Once every so often one would nervously approach the guards and show their medals. “Come back later” was all they got. That's right, we're all too early."
    nvlDC"\n Early or no, this is not good at all!"
    nvlDC"\n And then all of a sudden, I feel a cold draft up my back."

    C0" Oh. Look who decided to pay me a visit. What an honor!"

    " I spin around. There stands Hanes, arms folded. Both himself and his two stick-wielding attendants are clad in garishly colorful clerical robes."
    "Are my eyes deceiving me, or are Hanes' eyes even tinier today than it normally is?"

    A"  Hanes."

    " Not counting teeth-grinding, what am I to say to Hanes? After all that happened, how am I to be a friend to him again?"

    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" L-look at you, Anatolio. It's a h-happy day, w-why the l-long face?"

    " He turns his nose up."

    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" O-oh, but w-who am I kidding. It's Azzurra the Troub-troublemaker again. Am. I. Right?"
    A"  Mocking us, Hanes?"
    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" Maybe. Maybe not. Truth, is what I say. If y-you're unhappy with that, w-why b-blame me?"
    A" And you have nothing to do with that, huh? Yeah, and I'm a flying unicorn!"
    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" I-it is as I said! I was only following o-orders! "
    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" H-how can I... w-who am I to resist a direct o-order?"
    A" I dare you, Hanes: Look us in the eyes. Azzurra, and mine. "
    A" And swear you were only following orders."

    " Hanes' tiny eyes widen. He shakes his head, and begins to giggle."

    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" T-the joke was y-yours, Anatolio!"
    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" W-why would s-someone like me sw-swear a sacred oath ov-over nothing? That's just dis-disdain for the Creator!"
    A" You know what this will do to Azzurra, and you play your part in it anyway. Where's your conscience, huh? Eaten by vengeance?"
    H" Call it what you like. Oh, just a friendly reminder, the ceremony will begin in just a bit. You going in, or not? I mean you, not Azzurra, but that's so obvious it's insulting! To your intelligence!"
    " Azzurra's hand tightens around my wrist. Anger? Hatred? Or fear?"
    " But then a thought flashes to me. I stare him in the eyes."

    A"  Hanes."
    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" Mmm? Something's on y-your mind, my dear ge-genius?"

    " He knows this. That's why he's trying to tick me off, that must be it. But I can't do that. I can't cause trouble right now, for my loved ones' sake. For Azzurra."
    "And then my eyes meet the two attendants on his side, and a plan springs up in my mind. A hare-brained one... but that's all I have."

    A" How long have we known each other?"
    show Azu Hanes P1 at center
    H" … Ten years. Eight months. Twenty days and four. One hour and thirteen minutes as we speak."

    " I nod. If not for his newly acquired taste for power, Hanes could very well have become a mathematician – a better one than me, anyway."

    A"  I have always helped you. Saved you from bullying. My parents consider you the second son they've never had. "
    A"I never held any back from you – food to toys to my blood, toil and sweat."
    H"That's a long time ago... and you probably didn't mean me any good anyway. Like I said."
    A"But a good turn is a good turn. Surely the Creator dictates you would owe me a debt of some sort, wouldn't He?"
    
    "Hanes roll his eyes, as if asking “Are you serious”?"
    
    H" Well, much as I hate to admit... you are right. I do owe you. "
    
    "Bingo. Show of hands, now!"
    
    A" If I asked you for some repayment, what would you say?"
    
    "For a second, his stare intensifies. But then he draws a deep breath: the two attendants are looking at him intently."
    "Of course they would. The Creator extols two virtues most of all: Mercy, and gratefulness. Hanes' pomp and newfound arrogance is working against him."

    " Show of hands, Anatolio."

    A" Azzurra getting in, in exchange for clearing all debts – neither of us owing the other anything from today on. What say you?"

    " Hanes swallows hard. He's not looking at me now, but rather at his fellow clerics. They're actually watching him closely, with about as much interest as I am showing. Which is to say, a lot."

    H" … Well, er.."
    "I place a hand on his shoulder. Just like the old times, I think. Let's pretend everything is like they should be, and nothing has changed between us."
    A"   I've trusted you, Hanes. I still do. I still can't blame you after all this."
    A"  If your conscience remains, you will help me. For me, for Azzurra, and for the love of the Creator."
