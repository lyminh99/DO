    "“Quantum physics”? Now where have I heard that before?"
    "Azzurra. She said something to that effect that day!"

    Az" Perhaps even quantum physics – science of the highest order, isn't going to explain what I need to know. What I must know. Not with this sort of research, anyway."
    A" I mean... when I saved Azzurra, she told me this ;quantum physics' isn't going to answer all the questions she has."

    " Mr. Attenborough's eyes twinkles."

    Pa" Oh, really now? Now this is... interesting."
    A" Something wrong, Mr. Attenborough?"
    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa" I'll be honest – the girl's spoken my mind. I reckon there is something out there, something so unfathomably unreachable, beyond the grasp of conventional scientific methodology."
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" The question is how Azzurra could have thought as much, and so decisively too..."
    A" Wait, you mean you don't know too?"
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" Young man, you can't be a scientist without confessing that you don't know all thing. Besides, this doesn't make too much sense, does it?"
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" My three friends here are cut-and-dry evidence worshippers. "
    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa" They will drown themselves in a cesspit before admitting there can't be a falsifiable evidence for everything."
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" That begs the question: From where did Azzurra learn that from?"

    " And just how am I supposed to know that?"

    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa" I must say she knows much. Too much. We can't not give this matter a good long think."

    " I hope that isn't meant to be a threat. I hope."

    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" You can rest assured. Everything is still under good control."
    A" Thank you, sir. Though..."
    A" I'd be much obliged if you'd let me know how I can go about protecting her from now on."
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" I won't worry so much about it if I were you."
    A" Why not? How can I ever rest easy knowing-"
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" To most people I'd say 'you'll thank me when the time comes'. But I know you won't like hearing that."
    A" ..."

    " I also don't like being interrupted all too often. Just so you know."

    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa" So I will tell you that Azzurra is being protected. By whom and how? That's a matter of utmost secrecy."
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" As for your friend Hanes, as you've probably found out: He's got a rather terminal case of megalomania. "
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" Thinks he knows all that there is to know about the Church and Aurora. In truth... he knows less than you do."
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" There are forces at work you won't know until it hits you in the face."
    A" 'Forces'?"
    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa" Let's say every organization in existence has a wealth of skeletons in their figurative closets "
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" that outsiders and newcomers aren't aware of.  "
    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa" For the likes of the Church and to a lesser extent ourselves? That's not a few skeletons, but an entire cemetery."
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" Hanes seems to take everyone for fools. That he's the only one with a brain. Silly, and rather pitiable."

    " He clicks his tongue, and drops a thin smirk."

    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" Think for yourself what this means."

    " He pats me on the shoulder.."

    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" If you are truly worried about Azzurra, then behave as per normal tomorrow and cause no trouble. Then everything will be as they should be."
    A" Are you sure about that?"
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" I can guarantee you on my own honor, and that of the Organization."
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" Besides..."
    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa" Let's just say we have our own benefits to gain with Azzurra becoming an accepted member of society. We're on the same boat."
    A" I'm not so sure about that-"
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" Well, you should be! After all, we can use someone like you."

    " Wait…"
    " … what?"

    A"  Pardon me? A-are you jesting? Use someone like me?"
    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa" We don't jest when it comes to work. Consider this an official invitation, from the man himself."
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" … Of course I won't force you to shake or nod right about now. You can naturally say no. Your individual rights: we respect that much."
    A" Will I not be silenced if I say no?"

    " Paul's palm hits his face with an audible slap. Then he burst out in a string of throaty laughter.."

    Pa" Just a copper coin every time someone says that, my young man, and I can retire early!"
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa"  No, lad, do me a favor and erase between your ears the thought that Aurora is like a bunch of thugs who murder for a living."
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" That's the Church's business, we shall let them have it without competition."
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa"  As for them, well, they know as much as you do. They'll leave you alone."
    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa" One more thing..."
    A" Which is...?"
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" Suppose the “great sky fairy” decides you aren't worth being recognized as a human being, you will have to join us."
    show Azu Paul P2 at center
    Pa" Am I right?"
    A" Ehhh... that's not as fun as you seem to think, sir?"
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" Of course not. You have a family and quite a few friends, no? I'm just saying that suppose that happens,"
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa"  we'll welcome you into our big happy family, where the curious befriend the rejected befriend the slightly mad."

    " I groan. Others might take it as a something of a honor. After all that, I just want to have my peaceful life back."

    A" As for tomorrow, you say..."
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" As I said. Rest assured, do your duties as a boy about to become a man. "
    show Azu Paul P0 at center
    Pa" Pray, if you'd like – faith has its use as long as you keep it from interfering with the scientific method."
    show Azu Paul P1 at center
    Pa" Most importantly, don't make a fuss. Everything's already decided."
