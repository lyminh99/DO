    E" Ana is being unreasonable, isn't he? Is Elena not allowed to be here?"
    "In front of me stands my noble lady, attractive and smart in equal measures. On her side, as per normal, are her array of loyal muscle-headed footmen."
    E" That should be Elena's question for Ana. Where should Ana happen to be going? Not, perhaps, to visit Elena herself?"
    A" Ah, well... I was... I'm going to the cathedral."

    Az" Really! We have an appointment with Hanes. Elena, want to join us?"

    E" No! Today Elena shall not partake."
    "Elena looks... regretful. Does she have something important to attend to?"
    "Strange, does her ladyship Elena has something else more pressing than having fun?"
    E" Well, do have a good day. Ana, have fun."
    A" B-but of course."
    "Elena, being Elena, just glided across without waiting for my answer. Her hair screens across my cheek. What an odd sensation."
