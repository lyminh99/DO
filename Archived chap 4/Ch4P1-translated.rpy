    nvlDC"\nToday the sky is choked with clouds. Is it any surprise, looking at those baguette-shaped clouds up the stratosphere, that rain would come at any moment now?"
    nvlDC"\nWell, that's the same story yesterday, and the day before yesterday, and the day before that, and every other day this season."
    nvlDC"\nThe rain itself isn't any great concern to me. A little drizzle is hardly enough to wet the street. What really does matter is the cold and fog – it looks as if the air itself has condensed into a dense mass."
    nvlDC"\nIt takes but a few steps and I can no longer see the roof of our little sundry store. Looks awfully eerie if you ask me, not unlike those dusty tomes deep in Mr. Ascenderos' store he never looks after."
    nvlDC"\nThe one good thing about the weather is not so many people bother to go out into the streets these days. They'd keep themselves occupied indoors, be it home or taverns."
    nvlDC"\nThe carriages traveling along the cobblestone have all become equally timid. Which is heaven for the kids: the streets are now their turf for once."
    nvlDC"\nIn a sense, it's good for me. The air is refreshingly cool, and I have all the space I want to explore the less traveled paths."
    nvlDC"\nPerhaps I have never grown up from my childhood love for unlimited imagination. There is infinite fun to be had as long as I keep my eyes peeled and my mind open."

    nvlDC"\nThe second De'Rovere bridge stretches before my eyes as I walk up the main street. The bridge looks so diminished now, swallowed by the fog as it is. Father Fredo's old chapel looms in the distance behind the curtain, as opaque and mysterious as a fairy-tale sorcerer's lightning-cloaked tower."
    nvlDC"\nIt has been three years now since they closed the bridge. For good measures an iron gate was erected shortly after, when it seemed even a regular Templar squad isn't enough."
    nvlDC"\nI don't know when they would finish that so-called investigation. They may well never do, but then after a while we found that the closure really didn't affect everyday life that much."
    nvlDC"\nLocked though as it is, the stone bridge's fate looks infinitely better than the first bridge bearing the De'Rovere name."
    nvlDC"\nThat first one has come tumbling down a year ago. At the end of the day all that it took to knock it to pieces was a minor earthquake."
    nvlDC"\nSince then nobody seems bothered to give it a build-over. That's fine: It has become a new normal. Perhaps the bridge itself was the only victim of this debacle, it shall thus rest in pieces."
    nvlDC"\nIf you asked me what I regret the most over the last three years, that would be not meeting Elena again."
    nvlDC"\nOur dear De'Rovere princess happens to be ironically on our same boat despite being on the other side of the river."
    nvlDC"\nWe did promise to meet again real soon that last night we spoke. I wouldn't have given that seemingly simple word if I knew I wouldn't be able to fulfill it for years to come."
    nvlDC"\nI wonder how Elena looks these days. Just looking at Azzurra as a yardstick, I can't help but imagine an infinitely more elegant Elena, hiding somewhere in my dreams"
    nvlDC"\nIt has to be that way. Elena is, after all, nothing short of ridiculously gorgeous. Tempestuous and hard to please, and a princess in all sense of the word, but also smart and kind – that alone set her above and beyond the rest of the nobility who'd give us common folks nothing but disdain."
    nvlDC"\nPerhaps that's why we miss her. I don't know when Azu first knew Elena – but she really does know so many of the high-born girl's secrets. Even those I myself don't know."
    nvlDC"\nI wonder if Elena misses us as much as we miss her."
    nvlDC"\nPart of me hopes not."
    nvlDC"\nAs a man in the in, I can say right here, right now: to miss someone is akin to a curse, and a curse should be exorcised. Forgetting things as a child do have unbidden benefits."

    nvlDC"\nWell, I do know one thing: Hanes is so very busy these days. Church business, he mentioned at some point, and Azzurra speculated that he's doing his best to finally become a priest proper."
    nvlDC"\nIn the meantime, I continue teaching Azzurra. It's routine, and therefore not very exciting."
    nvlDC"\nSometimes I wish I could add more color to this boring canvas of my life. There has to be more to it than such toys as a water clock, a “magic” spinning top, or a sprinkler that creates rainbows at will because of science."
    nvlDC"\nThere has yet to be an opportunity to prove myself. Mr. Ines' books and the wisdom in it could leave many more in awe, though for now I'd just rather spend time discovering more new things."

    "I can't say I didn't deserve being pushed to the ground. Of course, Azzurra being Azzurra, that was followed by a string of apologies as she helped me back on my feet."

    "I just realize, right now, I am standing next to a bench a fair distance from the bridge or the river."

    A" I... see?"
    "Something didn't add up. I can't recall having fallen asleep at all, much less there of all places. I don't think I have ever come close to that place before?"
    "Actually, to think of it, I've just realized I'm standing in a part of town I am not exactly familiar with. Had Azzurra not found me, I'd have to worry about finding my way home..."
    "Logically speaking, there are two possibilities."
    "Either I've sleep-walked through traffic and whatever hazards along the river bank."

    Az" Unless... you happened to hit your head on a branch or something and fell unconscious just now?"
    A" Why, that might just be it."
    "I shrug. Azzurra's joke has dispelled part of my fright. Not all of it, mind. At the very least I can deceive myself into believing Azzurra's explanation holds water."
    "After all, Anatolio Pietro is well known for overthinking things."
    "In any case, I am grateful, and shall cheer Azzurra up to return the favor."
    "I gesture to Azzurra."

    A" Azzurra! Wanna see something I've just dreamed up?"
    nvlDC"\nI steal a glance at Azzurra's surprised face, then begin on my work."
    nvlDC"\nI pick a dozen twigs all over the ground, each the size of a toothpick, and trim them to equal size. The end product is a collection of near-uniform, unbent little sticks."
    nvlDC"\nThen I arrange them in a rectangle, half a dozen laid parallel. The blades of wild grass now come in handy as makeshift strings. Now the material is ready, and  the sticks became two woven planks."
    nvlDC"\nI pick the better-looking one, and added four more sticks along the sides. My handiwork now looks like a miniature, crude baking tray."
    nvlDC"\nThen I tie the two planks together – the 'baking tray' on top, the flat one below, and fill the space in between with as many oak leaves as I can fit."
    nvlDC"\nNow that the whole construct has been secured, I pick the broadest, most intact leaf I can find in the vicinity, and pierce the last stick I've got through it. Then I plant the stick with the leaf attacked on the middle of the construct."
    nvlDC"\nThe last order of business is to place the whole thing on the water. Thankfully, the river is calm and peaceful these days, and my makeshift raft has no trouble staying afloat."
    nvlDC"\n	As river-worthy as a toy raft can ever get."

    nvl clear

    A" The leaves make for good water-proof material, see?"

    "I bask in Azzurra's admiration as I provide a very short explanation."
    "As to where that idea came from? Well, it flashed in my head just moments ago. And yet I pulled it off successfully from the first try."
    "It's almost like deja vu. And it feels strange and awesome in equal measures."
    "Azzurra stares at the floating raft, mesmerized. Then she lifts it off the water with both hands, as if handling an extraordinarily fragile and beautiful thing (Which my handiwork kind of is)  "

    show Azu P46 at center
    Az" Can I take it home?"
    "The raft is still wet, and droplets of water flow through Azzurra's fingers, pattering on the surface, raising tiny overlapping waves – it is almost refreshing."

    A" Right, shall we go home?"

    "I pat on Azzurra's shoulder, and receive a happy nod."
    "Azzurra isn't so grown up now, and returns to the self I am most familiar with, as a happy little girl, skipping all the way home overly pleased with my gift."
    "Along the way I hear sounds lingering in the air that sound surprisingly like people chattering. But no, that's just the wind."
