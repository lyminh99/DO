    Az" This one please!"
    BC" Here you go."
    "The afternoon shift passes without incident."
    "As the day comes to a close, Azzurra pulls me to the new market, bent on being as much of a spendthrift as she can get away with."
    "This time around, it is a bookstore that somehow bears a strong resemblance to Mr. Ascenderos' old one in more ways than one."


    BC" That's awesome. So someone paid me some attention at long last!"
    show Azu P26_1 at center
    Az" Y-yes?"
    BC" That's what the book says, dear. It's real happy, having an owner like you!"
    show Azu P40 at center
    Az" Is that so? Can you really hear what it says?"
    BC" But of course! It's screaming in joy!"

    show Azu P46 at center
    Az" That's really cool!"
    BC" Well, that's what we do. It really isn't different from owning a pet. Books are my family. Of course I'd understand them."


    "That's either the most blatant lies I've ever heard, or a really subtle (and rather brilliant) kind of sarcasm. Azzurra just scarfs them all down without questions."
    "Though I'm more inclined to think that's more like sweet-talking. She's just persuading good old Azzurra to buy up her stock of left-over tomes nobody bothers with any more."
    "And Azu? Nodding as if mesmerized."
    "And who's going to pay for that? I can hear my wallet screaming even from here, thank you very much."

    A" Nope."

    Az" Meanie. Fine, I'll pay it myself."
    A" Since when did you have spare cash?"

    show Azu P44 at center
    Az" Well, you'll lend me some, right?"
    A" And why should I lend you money to buy these... particularly unhelpful books?"

    "That's not to mention I'm starting to very, very much dislike this shopkeeper."
    "Now maybe it's just me, but I can see the eyes of a fox in hers. And then to confirm my doubts, she starts talking to the book again – only instead of whispering classily, she speaks with that noisy, frog-like tone, probably to persuade Azzurra rather than anything else"

    BCTS"  O book, my dear book. Not like I want to sell you off, my dear, dear darling. But you see, I'm no good reader, surely this young miss would keep you better than I ever can..."
    "She dusts the front cover, and when that doesn't work with all the sticky grime, she rubs it hard over the knee of her pants."
    "Now I'm at a dilemma. Azzurra looks like she's seriously going to lose sleep over not getting those books if I go all the way. On the other hand, I don't think I'd rather give this crafty woman a single coin."
    "Is there some way I can get between the horns?"
    "Well, I think there is."
    A" You see, Azzurra, here's a book lover who doesn't really want to part with hers. I think you know it best yourself. Would you rather cause her such pain and loss that you wouldn't want on yourself?"
    "Azzurra takes a step back. Of course the shopkeeper isn't going to have it. She steps in, rubs her hands, and assumes the sweetest voice she can muster"
    BCTS" No no no! It's because these books really like you! I have no choice but to basically give them away, you see – rare books, not gonna sell to just anyone."
    "Looks like I have to do it another way. I gesture Azzurra to step back – which she does with uncharacteristically little resistance."
    A" So what's your price?"
    BCTS" Rare book, as I said! One gold Janar is all I ask!"
    "Hold your horses, did I say I'm going to buy it?"
    A" Sounds good to me. Thing is, I don't bring along that much..."
    "I fish out a few spare coins from my purse – the old and bent bronze ones and by far the least valuable among my belongings."
    BCTS" Well, that's fine, we can—"
    A" Look, ma'am, that's a hard one, I know. I can't just take your prized books from you. Besides, We're not exactly what you would call a bibli- book lover. We can't exactly take that good care of these books as you do."
    A" How about... look, ma'am, the book prolly likes where it is. Wouldn't be so kind forcing it to move house permanently, no? How about we make a book leasing contract instead? We'd pay a deposit, cart the books home, and return it when we're done?"

    show Azu P50 at center
    Az"  Anatolio!"

    "Again, I wink at Azzurra. Not sure she fully trusts I can do this, but that's what I have to live with."
    BCTS" Now, here—"
    A" That's the only way I can do this. If you don't agree, well, more's the pity."
    BCTS" This doesn't—"
    A" Ah, then it's a pity, isn't it?"
    BCTS" … let's give it a try then."
    "I quickly cook up a contract, that basically boils down to a few things:"
    "Azzurra gets to borrow five books in her list, in exchange for three coppers each for a month, with a fine of ten coppers applicable per day overdue."
    "A recompensation of five silvers is payable if Azzurra somehow doesn't return the books, or leaves it overdue for too long."
    "Finally, breach of contract results in a fine of five coppers. Applicable to both sides."
    "Sounds good... at first glance. That, or maybe the bookshop owner doesn't take us seriously enough. So she signs, just as we do."
    "That is a mistake."
    A" Hey, Azzurra! Remember these are borrowed books! Keep an eye out you don't drop a buttered biscuit on the page like the last time!"
    A" Oh, and try not to read it while sleeping. Drooling over the pages is a big no-no!"
    A" And try not to tear pages out! This isn't your book to begin with! Though..."
    "I am just an inch from cackling evilly."
    A" Though you won't actually be fined if something were to happen to these very fine books."

    "I can hear her grinding teeth from several yards away."

    BCTS" Honestly though, I wasn't exactly lying just now."
    BCTS" Now I don't expect you young'uns to get it, but trust me when I say everything has their soul. Of course I can't hear or talk to a book's, but I can feel this much: books are most happy in the hands of smart people who can actually understand what they have to say. Such as you.."
    A" Well, then if money has soul, I'd rather like them to willingly fall into my purse, no?"

Once every so often them Templars would come round, rife through the store and carry off a bunch of what they call “forbidden material”. Perhaps they want to educate themselves for a change..."
    A" Do they now?"
    BCTS" That's right. More frequently as of late, for reasons only the Creator knows."
    BCTS" Your books, too. Pretty sure they said they're “questionable material” last time they came about. Take good care of them – be sure to hide them after you're done, just to be on the safe side..."

    "Elena is sitting."
    "Her hands are juggling a certain, oddly familiar sort of yellow fruit."
    "Her perfume matches the scent of the wilds perfectly, the wet grass and blooming flowers, and became part of a whole."
    "Part of a whole. Yes, the Elena before me no longer stands out like she normally does, but has become part of a poetic panorama – adding to rather than overwhelming that picture of a late afternoon in this woods."

    E" Ana. It's been a while. Elena has been waiting."
    "Her voice is still as melodious as it has ever been. Melodious, and mischievous, even more the latter – as she gathers as many of the yellow flowers as her hands can hold."
    "In a swift toss of her arm, the fruits and flowers take flight. The petal whirls in the sky, like a curtain of golden butterflies surrounding her."
    "A glittering ethereal."
    A" So this is where you are! I've been running after you all afternoon!"
    "Elena has become even more elegant than before, if such a thing is possible. Taller, more feminine, more... classy. Perhaps there's no chance Azzurra can ever be as beautiful as Elena is..."

    "It may be just me, but that saintly smile doesn't go well with her elegance. Never has, probably never will."
    E" But very well."
    "Elena stands up, and spins around in a dance of her own, then bows to me – as is the wont of a noble princess."
    E" Since Ana has been so... eager, Elena will accommodate seven of Ana's questions."
    "It is also her wont to play me like a fiddle without even trying."
    A" Then—"
    E" Not just yet."
    "Elena presses her fingertip to my lips. My mind goes blank just that moment, feeling nothing but the softness on her tiny finger."

    E" Elena hasn't finished."
    E" Ana can only ask one question at a time, that's the rule. Ana probably understands it is hardly courteous for a young man to bombard a noble lady with so many inquiries unbidden."
    E" That's not the image Ana wants for himself, right?"
    E" Seven questions, only."
    A" Fair enough. I'll take it slow."
    E" So go ahead, First question."
    A" What are you doing here?"
    E" Second."
    A" You haven't even answered the first!"
    E" Third."
    A" Are you playing me for a fool?"
    E" Fourth."
    A" Argh, I give up! Why did you lead me here?"
    E" Fifth."
    A" How've you been doing these last few years?"
    E" Sixth."
    A" Will we see each other again?"
    E" Right. Last one."
    "As she speaks, Elena tiptoes to the side, her graceful steps like an impromptu dance. An impromptu, and very much pure and natural dance, too, lending her the appearance like a fairy in so many tales."
    "A mischievous, mesmerizing fairy in red."
    E" What's wrong, Ana? Keep it coming!"
    A" …"
    E" Ana?"
    A" Uh... I'm still thinking."
    E" That being the case... Elena will answer all of Ana's questions. There's a piece of paper tucked over there."

    "Then she resumed her dance. I noticed she wasn't exactly pointing anywhere, but I can guess “over there” means that old stump she was sitting around just now."
    "And lo, there it is: a piece of paper, stuck between the bark."
    "It's a large sheet, neatly folded. And within lie lines after lines of evenly spaced cursive writings."
    "<DOCUMENT RECEIVED: >"
    "Chills."
    "I'm chilled to the bones."
    "How did Elena know everything I was going to ask?"
    "Telepathy? Or a contract with ancient spirits?"
    "No, that's so unlikely and unscientific."
    "Great, now I'm shivering..."
    "And then I feel a pair of hands, graceful yet cold, wrapping around my neck."

    A" That was then, this is now."
    E" Riiiight. Elena reserves her right to be doubtful..."
    "Elena shrugs one shoulder"
    E" But Ana has made Elena curious. What could possibly have changed the Ana that Elena has known?"
    A" That thing doesn't exist. Just that life and time tends to change people. Surprising, I know."
    E" So does that 'life and time' thing make Ana not miss Elena? Elena doesn't like the sound of that..."
    A" Well, not really."
    E" So Ana still misses Elena? That's really good."
    "Elena presses her head against my shoulder. Her right arm creeps around my back, holding me tight."
    "Wait, why is her dress so completely drenched?"
    E" Would Ana let Elena hold him for a while?"

    nvlDC"\n Here is a story worth relating:"
    nvlDC"\n In the middle of the taller buildings of bricks and stone in the City, there lies a small abode surrounded by a rather respectable garden. From outside one can see the endless green of the many potted plants in their elements."
    nvlDC"\n Now this abode's owner is this man. Not an ugly man, nor a freak of nature associated with that sort of isolated lifestyle. Now he stands in the middle of his garden, an old lullaby on the tip of his tongue and a pair of gardening scissors in his hand. Life's slow, and that is good.."
    nvlDC"\n “Mr. Mayor, your guest, sir.”"
    nvlDC"\n Says a woman's voice behind him."
    nvlDC"\n “And who would that be, hmm?”"
    nvlDC"\n “A gentleman, sir. Terribly tall and rather fierce, if you asked me!”"
    nvlDC"\n “So that's him, huh. Fair enough, tell him I'm waiting.”"
    nvlDC"\n His voice was uncharacteristically small, and overwhelmed by the sloshing of the watering can. The secretary seems to have caught the message in spite of the odds: she bows, and then turns around to attend to that business of the guest."
    nvlDC"\n Now the man returns to the lullaby. Every note that pass through his throat is produced with that kind of exquisiteness – like aged wine."
    nvlDC"\n He's in a good mood today. Very, very good mood."
    nvlDC"\n But then he doesn't have much opportunity to finish his song. The guest has arrived underneath a beige parasol. He is a man large and built like a mountain, wearing a head of white hair and a mass of equally white beard – like white bascinet with matching aventail."
    nvlDC"\n One of his hands is tucked behind his back. The other is clutching a gilded walking staff, “a gift from a friend” as he says."
    nvlDC"\n “Mr. Mayor,” says the guest, and bows accordingly to the man's status."
    nvlDC"\n Now the mayor puts down the watering can, and shuffles towards the guest. His throat makes a chuckling noise – so quiet as to be near inaudible."
    nvlDC"\n “The love for material things, you see, is like wine. The longer you keep it, the more intense the taste. And the more intoxicating it becomes.”"
    nvlDC"\n “Sensible,” says the large man."
    nvlDC"\n Then the mayor stands up, and bows to his guest."
    nvlDC"\n “Venerable Father, it is regrettable,” he said with a different kind of tone."

    "Thanks to Hanes, our situation ends up being a little better than it could have been."
    "I can see the carriage, trying to speed off rather unsuccessfully. The streets aren't exactly empty at this hour."
    "But then, even that doesn't help us as much as I thought it would."

    H" Stop! Halt! N-now!"
    "If there has been any doubt remaining as to the reality of the situation, Hanes has just smashed it. I can catch a glimpse of Azzurra's face inside – restraint by a shadowy figure."
    "Her mass of golden blonde hair flutters by the window."
    A" Azzurra!!"

    "We... were being stupid."
    "You can't really catch up with a horse-drawn carriage on foot."
    "Not even if our friend has just been kidnapped – I repeat, kidnapped – right before our eyes."
    "And lo, the carriage finally vanishes behind a turn of the road, and there wasn't a thing we can do about it."

    A" T-this isn't working!"

    show Azu Hanes P2 at center
    H" Then what does?"
    "Hanes' face is now a mix of anger and flummoxment."
    A" And how the heck am I supposed to know?"
    H" …"
    "I... should not have done that. Shouldn't have lost my temper..."
    "It's all I can do to take a deep breath and try to clear my mind."
    A" I... mean we need to calm down. We can't catch that carriage this way! Can we take a shortcut or something?"
    "I pull Hanes to the side of the road. We're now quite a bit away from the place just now, and the noise seems to have died down somewhat. I can finally blend into the crowd again, and that is good. That is really, really good."
    A" I bet it's just running around these parts. How about we split up and see if we can find it?"
    H" N-not a problem, though t-to where?"
    A" Let's just split now, okay?"
    "I point to the T-junction just ahead of us."
    A" See, one way goes to the center of the Quarter, and through to the lake. The other... well, I bet that leaves town."
    "Was that not what the woman just now had said?"
    "The chance that those who kidnapped Azzurra would take her to the city center is quite low. But if they do go that way, we'd be quite likely to run into them one way or another."
    "We don't have all the time in the world... so all I can think of doing is to hedge my bet."
    A" Which way, Hanes?."
    H" I-I'm fine with either. Y-you?"
    "Never count on Hanes to make a decision when it count. That being the case, I will..."
