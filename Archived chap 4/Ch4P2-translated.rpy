    H" S-Sun Festival?"
    A" That's the magic word!"

    "Hanes has apparently learn how to apparate like a specter, if only to scare me halfway to death."
    "We ended up dragging him leg-first (figuratively speaking) into Mr. Ascenderos' shop."

    "Creator has mercy, we are finally having a serious discussion for once."
    H" Y-yep, that's it. Of c-course I know, me h-head's throbbing because of it!"
    "Was that some sort of arrogance I hear in Hanes' voice? In any case, he lifts the teacup to his lips and slurped down the content, as if dying from thirst."

    H" S-So what's the m-matter with it?"
    A" The biggest problem is that there is no problem!"

    H" Ha-ha. My d-dear Ana, surely you jest. I-if you complained ab-about the medals l-looking like junk, or we've got your n-name wrong, I can f-fix that for you."

    H" As it is, we are p-proud of our work as the organizing committee!"
    A" Medal? What medal?"

    "Hanes stares at me. Then he turns towards Azzurra, making a face. If he could have read her thoughts by looking, he would have tried."

    H" What a-are you saying? S-shouldn't they have gi-given you the invitation and the m-medal last week?"
    A" What invitation?"
    "Hanes doesn't seem to get it until I spell it out to him."
    A" I don't understand what you're talking about, in other words."

    AS" Well I can fill that in for you."
    "Down Mr. Ascenderos places a cup in front of Hanes. The steaming tea seems to warm up everything around us. Although I suspect that might be his explanation that's doing the magic."
    AS" If you're going to the Sun Festival as a yet-to-be-of-age kid, you'll need your medal and invitation. That gets you into the coming-of-age ceremony."

    H" Thank you, s-sir."
    H" Wait, are you te-telling me you don't know a-any thing about it?"

    A" That is what I've been trying to say!"
    show Azu Hanes P2 at center
    H" B-but that doesn't-doesn't make any sense! Y-you too, Az-Azzurra?"
    "Azzurra nods."
    H" W-well, then we have a prob-problem here. B-but no worries, w-we still have time! I'll j-just jot that down as your c-complaint, and t-there!"
    "Hanes drags out a handbook from his jacket, and wrote a few words in that signature cursive writing of his."
    "Making a complaint, however, is the least of my concerns."
    A" I just want to know what the festival is."
    "Hanes puts away his notebook again. He knits his finger and presents himself before us like a full-fledged cleric speaking before the lambs."

    H" The Sun Festival has its roots centuries ago. Before history is recorded, some say. But don't mistake it for any half-baked popular festivity, mind! There's a reason it's held once every ten years – it's a most sacred occasion, the cornerstone of our civilization!"
    H" It is especially significant for those youngsters attending it for the firs time. We of the clergy call it the Witnessing, though the ordinary folks would just rather call it “coming-of-age”... which is kind of what it is to them. To us, well, it's the time when the Creator who dwells in the Sun and His Court would recognize a child as human."
    H" That's the 'coming of age' part."
    H" So anyway, to ease out the logistics of things, the Church would hand out medals to the folks who would be attending the ceremony. That's a mark most sacred, signifying that the bearer shall attend the Witnessing as invited by the Creator Himself."
    H" In addition, invitations will also be given out to the eligible folks, just to ensure they won't miss it."
    "The good news is that I realize Hanes' stuttering would cease whenever he puts on his clerical cap. Perhaps there is hope in him yet."
    "The bad news... well, there's something oddly serious and dark in the way Hanes presents his explanation."
    A" What if an eligible person somehow misses the ceremony? They'll have to stay a kid for another ten years?"
    "Hanes shakes his head. Cleric cap off."
    H" No. It gets w-worse."
    "Cleric cap on."
    H" If for any reason an eligible youth cannot attend this event most sacred—"

    AS"  In the eyes of laws, customs and society, well, they'd be animals."

    "Hanes' face tenses, and so does Mr. Ascenderos'. And mine, too, is having so many goosebumps."

    AS"  Well, that's what it does, in theory anyway. Can't recall a single soul who'd been “un-person'd” like so. Look at me, see? I'd be the least likely dude to be given the pass, and here I am!"

    "Mr. Ascenderos laughs – jovial as usual. Then he walks away, stretching his shoulder and yawns as if not giving a care to anything in life."
    "Hanes looks – and sounds – far less relaxed."

    H" We… might actually have a serious problem here."
    H" You see, the Creator makes all soul and guides them to their destiny in life through mysterious yet ultimately benevolent ways. That is why He will, in his infinite mercy and omnipotence, give everyone the opportunity to join His festival in time... unless they turn it down willfully."
    A" You mean..."
    H" That means this isn't joking matter."
    A" But I haven't turned down anything!"
    "How can I turn down an opportunity I've never received in the first place?"
    H" Hmm…"


    "Hanes closes his eyes, as if meditating."

    A" Well, you are Graced and I am not. That makes all the differences in life, doesn't it?"
    "As if on cue the both of us laugh out loud. "
    "It's been a while, ever since that incident (which I can say was ultimately Hanes' fault, and for that he's terribly regretful) that I've seen him acting so naturally."

    "It is only when Hanes is just about to leave the shop that a certain thing I need to know flashes in my mind."
    A" Oh, and I almost forgot. When's this festival taking place again?"

    "Hanes turns around."
    H" The sixth of June."
    "His voice suddenly becomes unnaturally sharp."
    A" Sixth of June? Isn't that the Day of the Great Darkness?"

    show Azu Hanes P0 at center
    H" And the Day of Enlightenment Eternal. As the good book says – beyond the deepest shadows comes light everlasting; within despair darkest belies hope eternal. Don't you read the scriptures at all?"
    "Hanes, it seems, can be as arrogant as anyone else. Then he closes the door, leaving a customary “So long” at the doorway."
