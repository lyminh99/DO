    "It's been how long again, since old Ines' passing?"
    "Ever since, Azzurra would visit his grave every year on his death anniversary."
    "Never without, I may add, a sorrowful face."

    "The City's great graveyard is situated towards the Northwest, in the middle of, one can say, nowhere."
    "You need to cross the great Astraea over a bridge very old."
    "The De'Rovere clan's built no bridge of stone here, no sir – needless to say not very many would visit the place."
    "So obviously we can't make that journey in our lonesome."

    H" H-hey, a-are you t-telling me these pe-people are tagging a-along?"
    "Hanes steals a glance at the rather uncomfortably large group of people clad in black riding in several commensurately large carriages behind us."
    "Dad isn't all to pleased to see them, too, though they have not reacted in one way or another."
    "Perhaps they'd been so used to be viewed upon with such disdain, they no longer give our displeasure a rat's behind."
    A" Well, that's the job she gave them."
    "I wouldn't resist if I were them."
    "The 'she' I mentioned, by the way, is by no means the sorrowful young lady in blue friend to both myself and Hanes."

    "Does Azzurra look like someone capable of such deed, in any case? I think not."
    "Yes, I did mean someone else, you know."
    "I think I don't have to clarify who that other person is, but then just for the sake of records I'll still spare some moments to recount the root of this incredible happenstance."

    H_AZ" Eeeeh?"
    A" I've read quite a few books, and from what I gather, there's no way we can do what we need to do in just a single month."

    H" T-that's no good! I-I've already made my o-oath! H-how can you g-give up without trying, Anatolio? I-is that n-not what you taught me?"
    A" That is what I did."
    "But then there is giving up before trying, and then there is complete, utter fable."
    A" My dear Hanes, let's look at it this way: There are three of us."
    "No funding, no physical power, no permission, nothing."
    "How are we supposed to even build a single rickety platform much less a water tower?" 
    A" Even if we had something like a hundred men from the Duke's own household, which is again utter fable, how are we getting everything, from calculations, planning, assigning workers, procuring material..."
    "to actually building the thing, done in a single month?"
    A" That's so silly it defies words!"
    "I pat him on the shoulder."
    A" There's nothing we can do."
    "Better wise up and give up, pal."
    "Now I should also spare a few words on the Northwest."
    "It used to be Aurora territories back in those tumultuous days a generation before."
    "Now it's completely cordoned off – some say the Church is afraid of the ghosts of a movement long trampled."
    "Fact of the matter is, you can't get there so easily."
    "I've heard Dad saying that beyond the inhabitable lands held by House De'Rovere and their vassals, the weather is as bad as it gets: too hot in summer, and all frozen in winter."
    "It is almost as if it has been created by the Creator's curses rather than blessings."
    "So if we are to build something of the caliber Hanes foolishly promised, we would need a great pump and an equally great aqueduct and pipeline system leading from the Astraea itself or further."
    "Preferably an underground system, too, so as to take advantage of what reserves there are underneath the ice if push comes to shove."
    "As I said, we need at the very least scores of laborers with a phenomenal amount of material, starting right away."
    "We aren't, obviously, in possession of any of that."
    A" Best course of action is return to Father Fredo and apologize to him."
    "Or make a better deal next time."
    "It is a declaration of failure, as little as I am to blame for the entire debacle."

    "Like something of a honed reflex, I leap out of the spot I was standing."
    "Because there Elena De'Rovere has jumped, as if she's been stalking the lot of us for a while now – and was she trying to grab me again?"
    E" What's the matter, Ana? Not feeling like an embrace?"
    A" Oh, please, please!"
    E" So, tell Elena."
    "What is the matter? And why would Ana need so many workers? Morning bug-catching, perhaps? Or llama-racing?"

    H" S-something of th-the sort, I am s-sure."
    "Hanes can't really tell a good lie to save his life."
    "The way he was trying to look away from Elena like a little boy caught without his homework, I'm not sure if he really want this noble girl into the “in” of what we're doing."
    "Well, guess what, old pal."
    "I've got other plans."

    "Elena has made herself into the guardian angel I need (though not necessarily the one I deserve)"
    "It might even be a bargain with the devil, or whatever."
    "In short, I'll take it."
    "I'll definitely take this one."

    nvlDC"And before I can pinch myself in the cheek, I've found myself at the helm of a very, very large crowd of laborer in the pay of House De'Rovere."
    nvlDC"\n Well, one thing I can say right now, it feels good to be in charge."
    nvlDC"\n According to my direction (which bears the same weight as Elena's), they'd follow us to the Northwest."
    nvlDC"\n That's where we'll run this gauntlet because of a completely nonsensical bet."
    nvlDC"\n Speaking of which, I am not entirely sure if that “request” was truly Hanes' suggestion, or an impossible challenge Father Fredo thought would be a good way to dissuade us from what we've sworn to do."
    nvlDC"\n Seeing Hanes' avoidance, I think the latter is a safer bet."
    nvlDC"\n I've heard..."
    nvlDC"\n things, about Father Fredo's past and how he dealt with Aurora members back in the day."
    nvlDC"\n I wouldn't say he's full of trickery, but then he'd certainly know how to manipulate people to whatever greater good he subscribes to."
    nvlDC"\n It would be so ironic being treated the same way as rebels by Father Fredo."
    nvlDC"\n I certainly hope we wouldn't end up like them if this little expedition for Science! goes away."
    nvlDC"\n Then again, I might well be thinking overly much for my own good."
    nvlDC"\n That's what the weird way Azu looks at me seems to hint at."
    nvlDC"\n I guess a bit of explanation on Azzurra's state of mind is in order."
    nvlDC"\n It seems she'd almost forgotten Mr."
    nvlDC"\n Ines' death anniversary this year, until I told Dad about our little expedition."
    nvlDC"\n He wasted no time reminding us of the day we both so very nearly missed."
    nvlDC"\n Should I be happy that Azzurra is beginning to overcome, directly or otherwise, the pain of losing her foster grandfather?" Or should I cloak myself in the same blanket of regret she'd no doubt put on herself?"
    nvlDC"\n I'll be honest."
    nvlDC"\n This stuffy atmosphere is making me go mad, and it isn't even my fault."
    nvlDC"\n I've got to do something."
