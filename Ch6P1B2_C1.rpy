    "Right, the document. I've got it on my person right here. That's no coincidence: I haven't dared to leave it in the open ever since."
    "I look around: Nobody suspicious anywhere in sight. Good. I produce the thing..."
    A" Here."
    "… and feel like a huge weight is lifted from my shoulder. Mr. Attenborough takes it over, sifts through the pages, and stops at a seemingly random page."
    "Time freezes around me. The man stands there, only shaking his greying head once every so often , his brows furrowing in (perhaps) disapproval."

    Pa" Not any that concerns you. You've done an excellent job. We'll remember this good turn you've done us."
